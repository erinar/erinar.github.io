<h2 id="pgepubid00001">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
<p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
<p>“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>
<p>This was invitation enough.</p>
<p>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”</p>
<p>“What is his name?”</p>
<p>“Bingley.”</p>
<p>“Is he married or single?”</p>
<p>“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</p>
<p>“How so? How can it affect them?”</p>
<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>
<p>“Is that his design in settling here?”</p>
<p>“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he <em>may</em> fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.”</p>
<p>“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”</p>
<p>“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <em>have</em> had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</p>
<p>“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</p>
<p>“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for <em>us</em> to visit him if you do not.”</p>
<p>“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</p>
<p>“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <em>her</em> the preference.”</p>
<p>“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”</p>
<p>“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</p>
<p>“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.”</p>
<p>“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <em>Her</em> mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0002"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00002">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:</p>
<p>“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</p>
<p>“We are not in a way to know <em>what</em> Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</p>
<p>“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”</p>
<p>“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p>
<p>“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</p>
<p>“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.”</p>
<p>“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</p>
<p>“To-morrow fortnight.”</p>
<p>“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”</p>
<p>“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”</p>
<p>“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if <em>we</em> do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”</p>
<p>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!”</p>
<p>“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <em>there</em>. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”</p>
<p>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</p>
<p>“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”</p>
<p>“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to hear <em>that</em>; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</p>
<p>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.</p>
<p>“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.”</p>
<p>“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.</p>
<p>“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <em>are</em> the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I <em>am</em> the youngest, I’m the tallest.”</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0003"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00003">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.</p>
<p>“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</p>
<p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</p>
<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</p>
<p>“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.”</p>
<p>“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.”</p>
<p>“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</p>
<p>“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”</p>
<p>“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt <em>me</em>; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</p>
<p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of <em>that</em>, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the <em>Boulanger</em>—”</p>
<p>“If he had had any compassion for <em>me</em>,” cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”</p>
<p>“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”</p>
<p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</p>
<p>“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting <em>his</em> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0004"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00004">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.</p>
<p>“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”</p>
<p>“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”</p>
<p>“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.”</p>
<p>“Did not you? <em>I</em> did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take <em>you</em> by surprise, and <em>me</em> never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”</p>
<p>“Dear Lizzy!”</p>
<p>“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.”</p>
<p>“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.”</p>
<p>“I know you do; and it is <em>that</em> which makes the wonder. With <em>your</em> good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</p>
<p>His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</p>
<p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.</p>
<p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00005">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him courteous.</p>
<p>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.</p>
<p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “<em>You</em> were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”</p>
<p>“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</p>
<p>“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that <em>did</em> seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he <em>did</em>—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and <em>which</em> he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”</p>
<p>“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</p>
<p>“<em>My</em> overhearings were more to the purpose than <em>yours</em>, Eliza,” said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just <em>tolerable</em>.”</p>
<p>“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”</p>
<p>“Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”</p>
<p>“Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With <em>them</em> he is remarkably agreeable.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”</p>
<p>“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”</p>
<p>“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with <em>him</em>, if I were you.”</p>
<p>“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you <em>never</em> to dance with him.”</p>
<p>“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend <em>me</em> so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a <em>right</em> to be proud.”</p>
<p>“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive <em>his</em> pride, if he had not mortified <em>mine</em>.”</p>
<p>“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</p>
<p>“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”</p>
<p>“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.”</p>
<p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0006"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00006">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with <em>them</em> was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he <em>did</em> admire her and to <em>her</em> it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</p>
<p>“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all <em>begin</em> freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show <em>more</em> affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</p>
<p>“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If <em>I</em> can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.”</p>
<p>“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”</p>
<p>“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”</p>
<p>“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.”</p>
<p>“Not as you represent it. Had she merely <em>dined</em> with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”</p>
<p>“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”</p>
<p>“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</p>
<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.</p>
<p>He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.</p>
<p>“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”</p>
<p>“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”</p>
<p>“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”</p>
<p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:</p>
<p>“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?”</p>
<p>“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.”</p>
<p>“You are severe on us.”</p>
<p>“It will be <em>her</em> turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”</p>
<p>“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”</p>
<p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.</p>
<p>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:</p>
<p>“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”</p>
<p>Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”</p>
<p>“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”</p>
<p>“Never, sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”</p>
<p>“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”</p>
<p>“You have a house in town, I conclude?”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy bowed.</p>
<p>“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”</p>
<p>He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:</p>
<p>“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:</p>
<p>“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</p>
<p>“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.</p>
<p>“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object to such a partner?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:</p>
<p>“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”</p>
<p>“I should imagine not.”</p>
<p>“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”</p>
<p>“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”</p>
<p>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:</p>
<p>“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”</p>
<p>“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I to wish you joy?”</p>
<p>“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”</p>
<p>“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”</p>
<p>He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0007"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00007">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.</p>
<p>She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.</p>
<p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.</p>
<p>Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.</p>
<p>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:</p>
<p>“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.”</p>
<p>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.</p>
<p>“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”</p>
<p>“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”</p>
<p>“Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”</p>
<p>“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”</p>
<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his regimentals.”</p>
<p>“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,</p>
<p>“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”</p>
<p>“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.</p>
<p>“MY DEAR FRIEND,—<br />
“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day’s <em>tête-à-tête</em> between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever,</p>
<p>“CAROLINE BINGLEY”</p>
<p>“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of <em>that</em>.”</p>
<p>“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”</p>
<p>“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.</p>
<p>“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”</p>
<p>“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.”</p>
<p>“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”</p>
<p>“I had much rather go in the coach.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”</p>
<p>“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”</p>
<p>“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose will be answered.”</p>
<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.</p>
<p>“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:</p>
<p>“MY DEAREST LIZZY,—<br />
“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, etc.”</p>
<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</p>
<p>“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”</p>
<p>“I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”</p>
<p>“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”</p>
<p>“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”</p>
<p>“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”</p>
<p>“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.</p>
<p>“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”</p>
<p>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.</p>
<p>She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.</p>
<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.</p>
<p>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.</p>
<p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00008">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.</p>
<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>
<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:</p>
<p>“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.”</p>
<p>“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must <em>she</em> be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”</p>
<p>“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.”</p>
<p>“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see <em>your sister</em> make such an exhibition.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not.”</p>
<p>“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”</p>
<p>“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.</p>
<p>“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:</p>
<p>“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”</p>
<p>“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.”</p>
<p>“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”</p>
<p>“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“If they had uncles enough to fill <em>all</em> Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”</p>
<p>“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.</p>
<p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.</p>
<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.</p>
<p>“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”</p>
<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”</p>
<p>“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am <em>not</em> a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”</p>
<p>“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others—all that his library afforded.</p>
<p>“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.</p>
<p>“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”</p>
<p>“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many generations.”</p>
<p>“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.”</p>
<p>“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.”</p>
<p>“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build <em>your</em> house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.”</p>
<p>“I wish it may.”</p>
<p>“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.”</p>
<p>“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”</p>
<p>“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”</p>
<p>“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.</p>
<p>“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will she be as tall as I am?”</p>
<p>“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or rather taller.”</p>
<p>“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”</p>
<p>“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”</p>
<p>“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”</p>
<p>“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”</p>
<p>“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.</p>
<p>“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”</p>
<p>“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.”</p>
<p>“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.”</p>
<p>“I am no longer surprised at your knowing <em>only</em> six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing <em>any</em>.”</p>
<p>“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> never saw such a woman. <em>I</em> never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.</p>
<p>“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is a meanness in <em>all</em> the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.”</p>
<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.</p>
<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0009"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00009">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</p>
<p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</p>
<p>“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.”</p>
<p>“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.”</p>
<p>“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>
<p>“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to <em>her</em>. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”</p>
<p>“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”</p>
<p>“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.</p>
<p>“Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.”</p>
<p>“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.”</p>
<p>“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”</p>
<p>“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”</p>
<p>“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but intricate characters are the <em>most</em> amusing. They have at least that advantage.”</p>
<p>“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.”</p>
<p>“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of <em>that</em> going on in the country as in town.”</p>
<p>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</p>
<p>“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”</p>
<p>“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”</p>
<p>“Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”</p>
<p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since <em>her</em> coming away.</p>
<p>“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. <em>That</em> is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”</p>
<p>“Did Charlotte dine with you?”</p>
<p>“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, <em>I</em> always keep servants that can do their own work; <em>my</em> daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that <em>I</em> think Charlotte so <em>very</em> plain—but then she is our particular friend.”</p>
<p>“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”</p>
<p>“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”</p>
<p>“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”</p>
<p>“I have been used to consider poetry as the <em>food</em> of love,” said Darcy.</p>
<p>“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”</p>
<p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>
<p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:</p>
<p>“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”</p>
<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given <em>your</em> ball,” she added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of <em>her</em>, in spite of all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on <em>fine eyes</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0010"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00010">Chapter 10</h2>
<p>The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</p>
<p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.</p>
<p>“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”</p>
<p>He made no answer.</p>
<p>“You write uncommonly fast.”</p>
<p>“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”</p>
<p>“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”</p>
<p>“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”</p>
<p>“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”</p>
<p>“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.”</p>
<p>“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”</p>
<p>“How can you contrive to write so even?”</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.”</p>
<p>“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice.”</p>
<p>“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”</p>
<p>“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.”</p>
<p>“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.”</p>
<p>“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her brother, “because he does <em>not</em> write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”</p>
<p>“My style of writing is very different from yours.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”</p>
<p>“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”</p>
<p>“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.”</p>
<p>“And which of the two do you call <em>my</em> little recent piece of modesty?”</p>
<p>“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”</p>
<p>“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”</p>
<p>“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month.”</p>
<p>“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.”</p>
<p>“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.”</p>
<p>“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”</p>
<p>“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.”</p>
<p>“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.”</p>
<p>“To yield readily—easily—to the <em>persuasion</em> of a friend is no merit with you.”</p>
<p>“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.”</p>
<p>“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”</p>
<p>“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?”</p>
<p>“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.</p>
<p>“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”</p>
<p>“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>
<p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.</p>
<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:</p>
<p>“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?”</p>
<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.”</p>
<p>“Indeed I do not dare.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.</p>
<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</p>
<p>“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.”</p>
<p>“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”</p>
<p>“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”</p>
<p>“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.”</p>
<p>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.</p>
<p>“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.</p>
<p>“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without telling us that you were coming out.”</p>
<p>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:</p>
<p>“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.”</p>
<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:</p>
<p>“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.”</p>
<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="pgepubid00011">Chapter 11</h2>
<p>When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.</p>
<p>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.</p>
<p>When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss Bennet.</p>
<p>Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy’s progress through <em>his</em> book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.”</p>
<p>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:</p>
<p>“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.”</p>
<p>“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.”</p>
<p>“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.”</p>
<p>“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.”</p>
<p>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</p>
<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?</p>
<p>“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.”</p>
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.</p>
<p>“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.”</p>
<p>“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”</p>
<p>“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”</p>
<p>“But upon my honour, I do <em>not</em>. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me <em>that</em>. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to <em>me</em> to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope I am not one of <em>them</em>. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, <em>do</em> divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.”</p>
<p>“Such as vanity and pride.”</p>
<p>“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.</p>
<p>“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”</p>
<p>“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment <em>is</em> a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot <em>laugh</em> at it. You are safe from me.”</p>
<p>“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”</p>
<p>“And <em>your</em> defect is to hate everybody.”</p>
<p>“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand them.”</p>
<p>“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?”</p>
<p>Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0012"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00012">Chapter 12</h2>
<p>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</p>
<p>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</p>
<p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.</p>
<p>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to <em>her</em>, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should <em>now</em> escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.</p>
<p>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.</p>
<p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="pgepubid00013">Chapter 13</h2>
<p>“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”</p>
<p>“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope <em>my</em> dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”</p>
<p>“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this moment.”</p>
<p>“It is <em>not</em> Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.”</p>
<p>This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.</p>
<p>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:</p>
<p>“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”</p>
<p>“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.”</p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.</p>
<p>“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.”</p>
<p>“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?”</p>
<p>“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.”</p>
<p>“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15<em>th October</em>.</p>
<p>“Dear Sir,—<br />
“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,</p>
<p>“WILLIAM COLLINS”</p>
<p>“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.”</p>
<p>“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.”</p>
<p>“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.</p>
<p>“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?”</p>
<p>“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”</p>
<p>“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.”</p>
<p>To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.</p>
<p>“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.”</p>
<p>“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”</p>
<p>“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with <em>you</em>, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.”</p>
<p>“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—”</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0014"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00014">Chapter 14</h2>
<p>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but <em>he</em> had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs.”</p>
<p>“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”</p>
<p>“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”</p>
<p>“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”</p>
<p>“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”</p>
<p>“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”</p>
<p>“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.”</p>
<p>“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.”</p>
<p>“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”</p>
<p>“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.</p>
<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:</p>
<p>“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”</p>
<p>Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:</p>
<p>“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”</p>
<p>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00015">Chapter 15</h2>
<p>Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.</p>
<p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.</p>
<p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening <em>she</em> was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s <em>tête-à-tête</em> with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to her <em>younger</em> daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not <em>know</em> of any prepossession; her <em>eldest</em> daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”</p>
<p>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.</p>
<p>Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.</p>
<p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by <em>him</em>. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.</p>
<p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.</p>
<p>In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.</p>
<p>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.</p>
<p>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0016"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00016">Chapter 16</h2>
<p>As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.</p>
<p>When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room.</p>
<p>In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as <em>they</em> were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.</p>
<p>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.</p>
<p>“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told—the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.</p>
<p>“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.</p>
<p>“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”</p>
<p>“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.”</p>
<p>“I have no right to give <em>my</em> opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for <em>me</em> to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”</p>
<p>“Upon my word, I say no more <em>here</em> than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”</p>
<p>“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with <em>him</em> I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”</p>
<p>“I should take him, even on <em>my</em> slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”</p>
<p>“I do not at all know; but I <em>heard</em> nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>“Oh! no—it is not for <em>me</em> to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If <em>he</em> wishes to avoid seeing <em>me</em>, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding <em>him</em> but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.</p>
<p>“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I <em>must</em> have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church <em>ought</em> to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”</p>
<p>“Indeed!”</p>
<p>“Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could <em>that</em> be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”</p>
<p>“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion <em>of</em> him, and <em>to</em> him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”</p>
<p>“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”</p>
<p>“Some time or other he <em>will</em> be—but it shall not be by <em>me</em>. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose <em>him</em>.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.</p>
<p>“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”</p>
<p>“A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me.”</p>
<p>“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.”</p>
<p>After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I <em>do</em> remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.”</p>
<p>“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “<em>I</em> can hardly be just to him.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like <em>you</em>, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable”—but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”</p>
<p>“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. <em>My</em> father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to <em>him</em>, as of his affection to myself.”</p>
<p>“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.”</p>
<p>“It <em>is</em> wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”</p>
<p>“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and <em>filial</em> pride—for he is very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also <em>brotherly</em> pride, which, with <em>some</em> brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.”</p>
<p>“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.”</p>
<p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:</p>
<p>“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.”</p>
<p>“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.”</p>
<p>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.</p>
<p>“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.</p>
<p>“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”</p>
<p>“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”</p>
<p>“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”</p>
<p>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.</p>
<p>“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”</p>
<p>“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00017">Chapter 17</h2>
<p>Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.</p>
<p>“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”</p>
<p>“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear <em>them</em> too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”</p>
<p>“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”</p>
<p>“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”</p>
<p>“It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to think.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”</p>
<p>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr. Bingley, if he <em>had been</em> imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.</p>
<p>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.</p>
<p>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.</p>
<p>“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.</p>
<p>“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that <em>she</em> was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to <em>her</em>. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</p>
<p>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00018">Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”</p>
<p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.</p>
<p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:</p>
<p>“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”</p>
<p>“Heaven forbid! <em>That</em> would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.”</p>
<p>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:—“It is <em>your</em> turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. <em>I</em> talked about the dance, and <em>you</em> ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.”</p>
<p>He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.</p>
<p>“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But <em>now</em> we may be silent.”</p>
<p>“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of <em>some</em>, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”</p>
<p>“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”</p>
<p>“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the <em>éclat</em> of a proverb.”</p>
<p>“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,” said he. “How near it may be to <em>mine</em>, I cannot pretend to say. <em>You</em> think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”</p>
<p>“I must not decide on my own performance.”</p>
<p>He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”</p>
<p>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of <em>hauteur</em> overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his <em>making</em> friends—whether he may be equally capable of <em>retaining</em> them, is less certain.”</p>
<p>“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.”</p>
<p>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.</p>
<p>“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”</p>
<p>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.”</p>
<p>“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”</p>
<p>“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.</p>
<p>“Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”</p>
<p>“No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.”</p>
<p>“The <em>present</em> always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said he, with a look of doubt.</p>
<p>“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its <em>being created?</em>”</p>
<p>“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.</p>
<p>“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”</p>
<p>“I hope not.”</p>
<p>“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”</p>
<p>“May I ask to what these questions tend?”</p>
<p>“Merely to the illustration of <em>your</em> character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”</p>
<p>“And what is your success?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”</p>
<p>“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”</p>
<p>“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.”</p>
<p>“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.</p>
<p>They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:</p>
<p>“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”</p>
<p>“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of <em>that</em>, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. “Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”</p>
<p>“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.</p>
<p>“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”</p>
<p>“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”</p>
<p>“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”</p>
<p>“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”</p>
<p>“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him <em>conditionally</em> only.”</p>
<p>“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.”</p>
<p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.</p>
<p>“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”</p>
<p>“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”</p>
<p>“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s <em>nephew</em>. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:</p>
<p>“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”</p>
<p>As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.</p>
<p>In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.</p>
<p>“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing <em>he</em> may not like to hear.”</p>
<p>“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!”</p>
<p>Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.</p>
<p>At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”</p>
<p>Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.</p>
<p>“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.</p>
<p>To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.</p>
<p>She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.</p>
<p>The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.</p>
<p>When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for <em>her</em>, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00019">Chapter 19</h2>
<p>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:</p>
<p>“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?”</p>
<p>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:</p>
<p>“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.”</p>
<p>“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I <em>insist</em> upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.</p>
<p>“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there <em>not</em> been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”</p>
<p>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:</p>
<p>“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for <em>my</em> sake; and for your <em>own</em>, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”</p>
<p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</p>
<p>“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.”</p>
<p>“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”</p>
<p>“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make <em>me</em> happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.”</p>
<p>“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:</p>
<p>“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.”</p>
<p>“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.”</p>
<p>“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”</p>
<p>“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.”</p>
<p>“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.”</p>
<p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0020"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00020">Chapter 20</h2>
<p>Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.</p>
<p>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.</p>
<p>“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will <em>make</em> her know it.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”</p>
<p>“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”</p>
<p>She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.</p>
<p>“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”</p>
<p>“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”</p>
<p>“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”</p>
<p>“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.”</p>
<p>“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.</p>
<p>“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?”</p>
<p>“I have, sir.”</p>
<p>“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”</p>
<p>“Yes, or I will never see her again.”</p>
<p>“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do <em>not</em> marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you <em>do</em>.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to <em>insist</em> upon her marrying him.”</p>
<p>“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.”</p>
<p>Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.</p>
<p>While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”</p>
<p>Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.”</p>
<p>Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. <em>I</em> shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”</p>
<p>Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”</p>
<p>“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my <em>manner</em> has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0021"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00021">Chapter 21</h2>
<p>The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, <em>his</em> feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.</p>
<p>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt’s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence <em>had</em> been self-imposed.</p>
<p>“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”</p>
<p>She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.</p>
<p>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:</p>
<p>“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.”</p>
<p>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.</p>
<p>“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.”</p>
<p>“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”</p>
<p>“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.”</p>
<p>“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.”</p>
<p>“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he <em>should</em>.”</p>
<p>“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know <em>all</em>. I <em>will</em> read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, <em>we</em> are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?”</p>
<p>“What do you think of <em>this</em> sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”</p>
<p>“Most willingly.”</p>
<p>“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.”</p>
<p>Jane shook her head.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been <em>one</em> intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of <em>your</em> merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”</p>
<p>“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.”</p>
<p>“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.”</p>
<p>“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.”</p>
<p>“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.”</p>
<p>“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”</p>
<p>The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.</p>
<p>She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.</p>
<p>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.</p>

<p>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.</p>
<p>In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.</p>
<p>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of <em>coming out</em> a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.</p>
<p>As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.</p>
<p>“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:</p>
<p>“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.”</p>
<p>“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”</p>
<p>“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that <em>we</em> shall take no offence.”</p>
<p>“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.”</p>
<p>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.</p>
<p>The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:</p>
<p>“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!”</p>
<p>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:</p>
<p>“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”</p>
<p>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.</p>
<p>“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0023"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00023">Chapter 23</h2>
<p>Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”</p>
<p>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!</p>
<p>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.</p>
<p>Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.</p>
<p>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.</p>
<p>Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth’s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.</p>
<p>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.</p>
<p>Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.</p>
<p>As for Jane, <em>her</em> anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that <em>I</em> should be forced to make way for <em>her</em>, and live to see her take her place in it!”</p>
<p>“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that <em>I</em> may be the survivor.”</p>
<p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.</p>
<p>“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.”</p>
<p>“What should not you mind?”</p>
<p>“I should not mind anything at all.”</p>
<p>“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.”</p>
<p>“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should <em>he</em> have it more than anybody else?”</p>
<p>“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0024"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00024">Chapter 24</h2>
<p>Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.</p>
<p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.</p>
<p>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:</p>
<p>“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.</p>
<p>“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not <em>that</em> pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better.”</p>
<p>With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.”</p>
<p>“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.”</p>
<p>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister’s warm affection.</p>
<p>“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. <em>You</em> wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. <em>I</em> only want to think <em>you</em> perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!”</p>
<p>“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and Charlotte’s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.”</p>
<p>“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.”</p>
<p>“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned <em>two</em> instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking <em>that person</em> to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.”</p>
<p>“And men take care that they should.”</p>
<p>“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”</p>
<p>“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.”</p>
<p>“And do you impute it to either of those?”</p>
<p>“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”</p>
<p>“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”</p>
<p>“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”</p>
<p>“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.”</p>
<p>“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.”</p>
<p>“Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane’s good fortune.”</p>
<p>“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0025"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00025">Chapter 25</h2>
<p>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.</p>
<p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.</p>
<p>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.</p>
<p>“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.</p>
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”</p>
<p>“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not do for <em>us</em>. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.”</p>
<p>“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how <em>violent was</em> Mr. Bingley’s love?”</p>
<p>“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to <em>you</em>, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence.</p>
<p>“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.”</p>
<p>“And <em>that</em> is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have <em>heard</em> of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”</p>
<p>“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? <em>She</em> will not be able to help calling.”</p>
<p>“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”</p>
<p>But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s attractions.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.</p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman’s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00026">Chapter 26</h2>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:</p>
<p>“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against <em>him</em>; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on <em>your</em> resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”</p>
<p>“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.”</p>
<p>“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! <em>that</em> abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not <em>remind</em> your mother of inviting him.”</p>
<p>“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from <em>that</em>. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.”</p>
<p>Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “<em>wished</em> they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:</p>
<p>“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> you certainly shall.”</p>
<p>“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”</p>
<p>“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”</p>
<p>“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.</p>
<p>“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.”</p>
<p>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.</p>
<p>Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.</p>
<p>Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.</p>
<p>“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”</p>
<p>She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.</p>
<p>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.</p>
<p>“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though <em>we</em> know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”</p>
<p>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that <em>she</em> would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.</p>
<p>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards <em>him</em>; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00027">Chapter 27</h2>
<p>With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.</p>
<p>The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</p>
<p>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.</p>
<p>Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.</p>
<p>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</p>
<p>Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.</p>
<p>“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”</p>
<p>“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.”</p>
<p>“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.”</p>
<p>“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”</p>
<p>“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death made her mistress of this fortune.”</p>
<p>“No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain <em>my</em> affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?”</p>
<p>“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.”</p>
<p>“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If <em>she</em> does not object to it, why should <em>we</em>?”</p>
<p>“<em>Her</em> not objecting does not justify <em>him</em>. It only shows her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.”</p>
<p>“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. <em>He</em> shall be mercenary, and <em>she</em> shall be foolish.”</p>
<p>“No, Lizzy, that is what I do <em>not</em> choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”</p>
<p>“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.”</p>
<p>“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”</p>
<p>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.</p>
<p>“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”</p>
<p>No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we <em>do</em> return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We <em>will</em> know where we have gone—we <em>will</em> recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let <em>our</em> first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0028"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00028">Chapter 28</h2>
<p>Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.</p>
<p>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</p>
<p>From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.</p>
<p>She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I <em>should</em> say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”</p>
<p>“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”</p>
<p>“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”</p>
<p>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</p>
<p>About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.</p>
<p>“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.”</p>
<p>“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”</p>
<p>“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”</p>
<p>“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.”</p>
<p>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.</p>
<p>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00029">Chapter 29</h2>
<p>Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.</p>
<p>“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!”</p>
<p>“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”</p>
<p>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.</p>
<p>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth—</p>
<p>“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.”</p>
<p>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James’s.</p>
<p>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</p>
<p>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.</p>
<p>From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.</p>
<p>In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.</p>
<p>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.</p>
<p>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.</p>
<p>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.</p>
<p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,</p>
<p>“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?”</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>“Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”</p>
<p>“One of them does.”</p>
<p>“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>
<p>“What, none of you?”</p>
<p>“Not one.”</p>
<p>“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”</p>
<p>“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”</p>
<p>“Has your governess left you?”</p>
<p>“We never had any governess.”</p>
<p>“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.</p>
<p>“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.”</p>
<p>“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.”</p>
<p>“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am, all.”</p>
<p>“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps <em>she</em> is full young to be much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on <em>such</em> a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”</p>
<p>“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”</p>
<p>“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”</p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.</p>
<p>“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.”</p>
<p>“I am not one-and-twenty.”</p>
<p>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.</p>
<p>When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0030"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00030">Chapter 30</h2>
<p>Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.</p>
<p>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.</p>
<p>Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.</p>
<p>Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.</p>
<p>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins’s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.</p>
<p>In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.</p>
<p>His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:</p>
<p>“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.</p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment’s pause, added:</p>
<p>“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?”</p>
<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0031"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00031">Chapter 31</h2>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.</p>
<p>The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.</p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. <em>His</em> eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:</p>
<p>“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”</p>
<p>“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.</p>
<p>“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.</p>
<p>“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.”</p>
<p>“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.”</p>
<p>“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part of the house.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made no answer.</p>
<p>When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:</p>
<p>“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister <em>does</em> play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”</p>
<p>“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”</p>
<p>“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.</p>
<p>“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”</p>
<p>“You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”</p>
<p>“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.”</p>
<p>“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”</p>
<p>“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?”</p>
<p>“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”</p>
<p>“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.”</p>
<p>“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe <em>my</em> fingers as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”</p>
<p>Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”</p>
<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:</p>
<p>“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry <em>her</em>, had she been his relation.</p>
<p>Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was ready to take them all home.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0032"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00032">Chapter 32</h2>
<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.</p>
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within.</p>
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting <em>when</em> she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:</p>
<p>“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly so, I thank you.”</p>
<p>She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:</p>
<p>“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?”</p>
<p>“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.”</p>
<p>“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.”</p>
<p>“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.</p>
<p>He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.”</p>
<p>“I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”</p>
<p>“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.”</p>
<p>“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”</p>
<p>“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”</p>
<p>“I should never have considered the distance as one of the <em>advantages</em> of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled <em>near</em> her family.”</p>
<p>“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”</p>
<p>As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:</p>
<p>“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case <em>here</em>. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself <em>near</em> her family under less than <em>half</em> the present distance.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “<em>You</em> cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. <em>You</em> cannot have been always at Longbourn.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:</p>
<p>“Are you pleased with Kent?”</p>
<p>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The <em>tête-à-tête</em> surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.</p>
<p>“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.”</p>
<p>But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.</p>
<p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.</p>
<p>She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.</p>
<p>In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00033">Chapter 33</h2>
<p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying <em>there</em> too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.</p>
<p>She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:</p>
<p>“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”</p>
<p>“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”</p>
<p>“No, I should have turned in a moment.”</p>
<p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.</p>
<p>“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.</p>
<p>“Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.”</p>
<p>“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”</p>
<p>“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.”</p>
<p>“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”</p>
<p>“These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.”</p>
<p>“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.”</p>
<p>“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.”</p>
<p>“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”</p>
<p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:</p>
<p>“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”</p>
<p>“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.”</p>
<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:</p>
<p>“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”</p>
<p>“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”</p>
<p>“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”</p>
<p>“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy <em>does</em> take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”</p>
<p>“What is it you mean?”</p>
<p>“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.”</p>
<p>“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”</p>
<p>“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”</p>
<p>“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”</p>
<p>“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.”</p>
<p>“And what arts did he use to separate them?”</p>
<p>“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He only told me what I have now told you.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.</p>
<p>“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”</p>
<p>“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”</p>
<p>“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.”</p>
<p>“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”</p>
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world <em>two</em> men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, <em>he</em> was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.</p>
<p>“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.</p>
<p>“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections <em>there</em> had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend’s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.</p>
<p>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather displeased by her staying at home.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0034"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00034">Chapter 34</h2>
<p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.</p>
<p>She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.</p>
<p>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:</p>
<p>“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.</p>
<p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He <em>spoke</em> of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:</p>
<p>“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could <em>feel</em> gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:</p>
<p>“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little <em>endeavour</em> at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”</p>
<p>“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I <em>was</em> uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?”</p>
<p>As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:</p>
<p>“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted <em>there</em>. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.”</p>
<p>She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.</p>
<p>“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.</p>
<p>With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards <em>him</em> I have been kinder than towards myself.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.</p>
<p>“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”</p>
<p>“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.</p>
<p>“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?”</p>
<p>“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.”</p>
<p>“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.”</p>
<p>“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:</p>
<p>“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.”</p>
<p>She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:</p>
<p>“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.”</p>
<p>Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:</p>
<p>“From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”</p>
<p>“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.”</p>
<p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.</p>
<p>The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0035"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00035">Chapter 35</h2>
<p>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.</p>
<p>After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—</p>
<p>“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.</p>
<p>“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.</p>
<p>“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If <em>you</em> have not been mistaken here, <em>I</em> must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.</p>
<p>“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.</p>
<p>“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has <em>particularly</em> accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character—it adds even another motive.</p>
<p>“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow—and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.</p>
<p>“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.</p>
<p>“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.</p>
<p>“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of <em>me</em> should make <em>my</em> assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.</p>
<p>“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0036"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00036">Chapter 36</h2>
<p>If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.</p>
<p>But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.</p>
<p>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.</p>
<p>The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.</p>
<p>She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was <em>now</em> struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that <em>he</em> should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.</p>
<p>How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.</p>
<p>“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”</p>
<p>From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation <em>there</em> had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.</p>
<p>When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.</p>
<p>The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.</p>
<p>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought—re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.</p>
<p>She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just <em>affect</em> concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0037"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00037">Chapter 37</h2>
<p>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.</p>
<p>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”</p>
<p>Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.</p>
<p>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:</p>
<p>“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.”</p>
<p>“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday.”</p>
<p>“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.”</p>
<p>“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”</p>
<p>“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another <em>month</em> complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”</p>
<p>“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.”</p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to <em>you</em> to let them go alone.”</p>
<p>“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.”</p>
<p>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.</p>
<p>Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!</p>
<p>When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.</p>
<p>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.</p>
<p>When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0038"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00038">Chapter 38</h2>
<p>On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.</p>
<p>“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make <em>her</em> feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:</p>
<p>“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”</p>
<p>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.</p>
<p>“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.</p>
<p>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.</p>
<p>“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.</p>
<p>“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!”</p>
<p>“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.</p>
<p>“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!”</p>
<p>Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”</p>
<p>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a few days.</p>
<p>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.</p>
<p>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00039">Chapter 39</h2>
<p>It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.</p>
<p>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”</p>
<p>“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing her purchases—“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.”</p>
<p>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.”</p>
<p>“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.</p>
<p>“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “<em>that</em> would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”</p>
<p>“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at table. “What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!”</p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:</p>
<p>“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”</p>
<p>“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.”</p>
<p>“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”</p>
<p>“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.</p>
<p>“I am sure there is not on <em>his</em>. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her—who <em>could</em> about such a nasty little freckled thing?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of <em>expression</em> herself, the coarseness of the <em>sentiment</em> was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!</p>
<p>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.</p>
<p>“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but <em>I</em> do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would <em>chaperon</em> you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are <em>such</em> friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And <em>that</em> made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”</p>
<p>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.</p>
<p>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:</p>
<p>“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”</p>
<p>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.</p>
<p>“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”</p>
<p>To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for <em>me</em>—I should infinitely prefer a book.”</p>
<p>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to <em>her</em> of the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.</p>
<p>She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0040"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00040">Chapter 40</h2>
<p>Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.</p>
<p>“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”</p>
<p>“Blame you! Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”</p>
<p>“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”</p>
<p>“But you <em>will</em> know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.”</p>
<p>She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.</p>
<p>“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s; but you shall do as you choose.”</p>
<p>It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.</p>
<p>“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.”</p>
<p>“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”</p>
<p>“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”</p>
<p>“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.”</p>
<p>“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the <em>appearance</em> of it as you used to do.”</p>
<p>“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”</p>
<p>“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!”</p>
<p>“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they <em>do</em> appear wholly undeserved.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.”</p>
<p>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”</p>
<p>“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it.”</p>
<p>“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”</p>
<p>The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”</p>
<p>She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.</p>
<p>“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion <em>now</em> of this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”</p>
<p>“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”</p>
<p>But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.</p>
<p>“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in <em>their</em> housekeeping, I dare say.”</p>
<p>“No, nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. <em>They</em> will take care not to outrun their income. <em>They</em> will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”</p>
<p>“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”</p>
<p>“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. <em>I</em> should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0041"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00041">Chapter 41</h2>
<p>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.</p>
<p>“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?”</p>
<p>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.</p>
<p>“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”</p>
<p>“I am sure I shall break <em>mine</em>,” said Lydia.</p>
<p>“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”</p>
<p>“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”</p>
<p>“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do <em>me</em> a great deal of good,” added Kitty.</p>
<p>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.</p>
<p>But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their <em>three</em> months’ acquaintance they had been intimate <em>two</em>.</p>
<p>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.</p>
<p>“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask <em>me</em> as well as Lydia,” said she, “Though I am <em>not</em> her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”</p>
<p>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:</p>
<p>“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.”</p>
<p>“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.”</p>
<p>“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”</p>
<p>“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:</p>
<p>“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.”</p>
<p>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.</p>
<p>Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.</p>
<p>Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there himself.</p>
<p>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving home.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.</p>
<p>On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.</p>
<p>He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:</p>
<p>“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”</p>
<p>“Nearly three weeks.”</p>
<p>“And you saw him frequently?”</p>
<p>“Yes, almost every day.”</p>
<p>“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”</p>
<p>“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And pray, may I ask?—” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.”</p>
<p>While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:</p>
<p>“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”</p>
<p>Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:</p>
<p>“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the <em>appearance</em> of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the <em>appearance</em>, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.</p>
<p>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00042">Chapter 42</h2>
<p>Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.</p>
<p>“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”</p>
<p>When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.</p>
<p>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.</p>
<p>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.</p>
<p>With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”</p>
<p>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.</p>
<p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.</p>
<p>“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0043"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00043">Chapter 43</h2>
<p>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.</p>
<p>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!</p>
<p>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.</p>
<p>The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.</p>
<p>“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”—recollecting herself—“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”</p>
<p>This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very like regret.</p>
<p>She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!</p>
<p>Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.</p>
<p>“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, “is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.”</p>
<p>“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.</p>
<p>“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”</p>
<p>“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”</p>
<p>“Yes, very handsome.”</p>
<p>“I am sure <em>I</em> know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.”</p>
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.</p>
<p>“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.</p>
<p>“Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.</p>
<p>“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”</p>
<p>“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”</p>
<p>“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”</p>
<p>“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; but I do not know when <em>that</em> will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.”</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”</p>
<p>“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.”</p>
<p>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:</p>
<p>“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.</p>
<p>“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.</p>
<p>“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”</p>
<p>“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps we might be deceived.”</p>
<p>“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”</p>
<p>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.</p>
<p>“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”</p>
<p>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.</p>
<p>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s lifetime.</p>
<p>There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.</p>
<p>When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.</p>
<p>As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.</p>
<p>They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.</p>
<p>She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.</p>
<p>At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.</p>
<p>The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.</p>
<p>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been <em>that</em> in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.</p>
<p>At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.</p>
<p>They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”</p>
<p>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was <em>surprised</em> by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for <em>me</em>—it cannot be for <em>my</em> sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”</p>
<p>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, <em>his</em> mind was not very differently engaged.</p>
<p>“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”</p>
<p>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.</p>
<p>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.</p>
<p>He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the <em>tête-à-tête</em> was over.</p>
<p>On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.</p>
<p>The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.</p>
<p>“There <em>is</em> something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, <em>I</em> have seen nothing of it.”</p>
<p>“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”</p>
<p>“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.</p>
<p>“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.</p>
<p>“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and <em>that</em> in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="pgepubid00044">Chapter 44</h2>
<p>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.</p>
<p>She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.</p>
<p>Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.</p>
<p>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.</p>
<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.</p>
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether <em>all</em> her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.</p>
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from <em>hauteur</em> or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.</p>
<p>Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how <em>she</em>, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</p>
<p>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.</p>
<p>But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</p>
<p>Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.</p>
<p>With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.</p>
<p>As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards <em>one</em> in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.</p>
<p>It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0045"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00045">Chapter 45</h2>
<p>Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.</p>
<p>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.</p>
<p>In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.</p>
<p>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.</p>
<p>Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.</p>
<p>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.</p>
<p>He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:</p>
<p>“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to <em>your</em> family.”</p>
<p>In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.</p>
<p>Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</p>
<p>“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”</p>
<p>However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.</p>
<p>“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.”</p>
<p>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:</p>
<p>“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘<em>She</em> a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but <em>that</em> was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”</p>
<p>He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit—of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s beginning the subject.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0046"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00046">Chapter 46</h2>
<p>Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.</p>
<p>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:</p>
<p>“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.”</p>
<p>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.</p>
<p>“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if <em>he</em> could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”</p>
<p>“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.”</p>
<p>“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.</p>
<p>On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”</p>
<p>“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”</p>
<p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. <em>You</em> know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.”</p>
<p>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet more agitated voice, “that <em>I</em> might have prevented it! <em>I</em> who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all—all too late now.”</p>
<p>“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it certain—absolutely certain?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.”</p>
<p>“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”</p>
<p>“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”</p>
<p>Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.</p>
<p>“When <em>my</em> eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”</p>
<p>Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything <em>must</em> sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.</p>
<p>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”</p>
<p>He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.</p>
<p>As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.</p>
<p>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.</p>
<p>She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!</p>
<p>She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?”</p>
<p>“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. <em>That</em> is all settled.”</p>
<p>“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”</p>
<p>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00047">Chapter 47</h2>
<p>“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!”</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.</p>
<p>“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?”</p>
<p>“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?”</p>
<p>“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”</p>
<p>“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.”</p>
<p>“Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”</p>
<p>“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that <em>he</em> would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”</p>
<p>“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”</p>
<p>“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”</p>
<p>“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”</p>
<p>“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”</p>
<p>“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.</p>
<p>“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.”</p>
<p>“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That <em>she</em> could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as <em>this</em> could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.”</p>
<p>“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”</p>
<p>“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished <em>her</em> by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”</p>
<p>It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.</p>
<p>They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.</p>
<p>The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.</p>
<p>Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well.”</p>
<p>“Is my father in town?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”</p>
<p>“And have you heard from him often?”</p>
<p>“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention.”</p>
<p>“And my mother—how is she? How are you all?”</p>
<p>“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.”</p>
<p>“But you—how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you must have gone through!”</p>
<p>Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.</p>
<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’ conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.</p>
<p>“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, <em>this</em> would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.”</p>
<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.</p>
<p>“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.”</p>
<p>“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, <em>make</em> them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”</p>
<p>But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.</p>
<p>Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that <em>one</em> only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.</p>
<p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:</p>
<p>“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”</p>
<p>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”</p>
<p>“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He <em>was</em> coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”</p>
<p>“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”</p>
<p>“Yes; but, when questioned by <em>him</em>, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from <em>that</em>, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”</p>
<p>“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”</p>
<p>“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.”</p>
<p>“But not before they went to Brighton?”</p>
<p>“No, I believe not.”</p>
<p>“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?”</p>
<p>“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”</p>
<p>“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his wife?”</p>
<p>“He brought it with him for us to see.”</p>
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:</p>
<p>“My dear Harriet,<br />
“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.</p>
<p>“Your affectionate friend,<br />
“L<span class="small">YDIA BENNET</span>.”</p>
<p>“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that <em>she</em> was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a <em>scheme</em> of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”</p>
<p>“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!”</p>
<p>“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.”</p>
<p>“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.”</p>
<p>“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if they should be of use to us.”</p>
<p>“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she <em>meant</em> well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”</p>
<p>She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.</p>
<p>“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00048">Chapter 48</h2>
<p>The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of <em>that</em> they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.</p>
<p>When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.</p>
<p>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister’s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:</p>
<p>“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.</p>
<p>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:</p>
<p>“My dear Sir,<br />
“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.</p>
<p>“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.</p>
<p>“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”</p>
<p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.</p>
<p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from <em>that</em>, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.</p>
<p>It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.”</p>
<p>“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose them to be in London?”</p>
<p>“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”</p>
<p>“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.</p>
<p>“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there will probably be of some duration.”</p>
<p>Then after a short silence he continued:</p>
<p>“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”</p>
<p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s tea.</p>
<p>“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”</p>
<p>“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If <em>I</em> should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”</p>
<p>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00049">Chapter 49</h2>
<p>Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”</p>
<p>“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”</p>
<p>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:</p>
<p>“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the little copse.”</p>
<p>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.</p>
<p>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:</p>
<p>“Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”</p>
<p>“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”</p>
<p>“Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”</p>
<p>“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.</p>
<p>“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is about.”</p>
<p>“Gracechurch Street, <em>Monday, August</em> 2.</p>
<p>“My dear Brother,<br />
“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both—”<br />
    “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”</p>
<p>Elizabeth read on:</p>
<p>“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,</p>
<p>“E<span class="small">DW. GARDINER</span>.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be possible that he will marry her?”</p>
<p>“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”</p>
<p>“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“No; but it must be done soon.”</p>
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.</p>
<p>“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”</p>
<p>“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble yourself.”</p>
<p>“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”</p>
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.</p>
<p>“And may I ask—” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.”</p>
<p>“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”</p>
<p>“And they <em>must</em> marry! Yet he is <em>such</em> a man!”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.”</p>
<p>“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”</p>
<p>“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.”</p>
<p>“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”</p>
<p>“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.”</p>
<p>“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.</p>
<p>“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for <em>this</em> we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”</p>
<p>“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?”</p>
<p>“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!”</p>
<p>“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.”</p>
<p>“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”</p>
<p>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:</p>
<p>“Just as you please.”</p>
<p>“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”</p>
<p>“Take whatever you like, and get away.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.</p>
<p>“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”</p>
<p>Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.</p>
<p>“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”</p>
<p>“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”</p>
<p>She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.</p>
<p>“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.</p>
<p>Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0050"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00050">Chapter 50</h2>
<p>Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.</p>
<p>He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.</p>
<p>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.</p>
<p>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.</p>
<p>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.</p>
<p>The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.</p>
<p>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.</p>
<p>“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”</p>
<p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into <em>one</em> house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”</p>
<p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.</p>
<p>She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her so much—not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.</p>
<p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.</p>
<p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.</p>
<p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.</p>
<p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.</p>
<p>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.</p>
<p>“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——’s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.—Yours, etc.,</p>
<p>“E. GARDINER.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.</p>
<p>“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——’s regiment.”</p>
<p>His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00051">Chapter 51</h2>
<p>Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had <em>she</em> been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.</p>
<p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.</p>
<p>Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.</p>
<p>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.</p>
<p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. <em>She</em> blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.</p>
<p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.</p>
<p>“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”</p>
<p>Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.”</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</p>
<p>“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”</p>
<p>“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”</p>
<p>“Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”</p>
<p>“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.</p>
<p>“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.”</p>
<p>“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”</p>
<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</p>
<p>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.</p>
<p>Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.</p>
<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.</p>
<p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:</p>
<p>“Lizzy, I never gave <em>you</em> an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”</p>
<p>“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.”</p>
<p>“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”</p>
<p>“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he <em>had</em> been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”</p>
<p>“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”</p>
<p>“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will ask you no questions.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.”</p>
<p>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.</p>
<p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.</p>
<p>“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”</p>
<p>“Not that I <em>shall</em>, though,” she added to herself, as she finished the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.”</p>
<p>Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.</p>
</div>

<p><span id="link2HCH0052"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00052">Chapter 52</h2>
<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.</p>
<p>“Gracechurch Street, <em>Sept</em>. 6.</p>
<p>“My dear Niece,</p>
<p>“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a <em>little</em> writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from <em>you</em>. Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on <em>your</em> side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.</p>
<p>“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as <em>yours</em> seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he <em>had another</em> motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than <em>we</em> had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.</p>
<p>“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been <em>his</em> design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.</p>
<p>“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.</p>
<p>“Everything being settled between <em>them</em>, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.</p>
<p>“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.</p>
<p>“They met again on Sunday, and then <em>I</em> saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but <em>this</em> is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</p>
<p>“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.</p>
<p>“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon <em>her</em>, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in <em>this</em>; though I doubt whether <em>his</em> reserve, or <em>anybody’s</em> reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for <em>another interest</em> in the affair.</p>
<p>“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.</p>
<p>“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. <em>He</em> was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with <em>her</em> behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and <em>that</em>, if he marry <em>prudently</em>, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.</p>
<p>“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.</p>
<p>“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.</p>
<p>“Yours, very sincerely,<br />
“M. GARDINER.”</p>
<p>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her—for a woman who had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.</p>
<p>She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.</p>
<p>“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he, as he joined her.</p>
<p>“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”</p>
<p>“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. <em>We</em> were always good friends; and now we are better.”</p>
<p>“True. Are the others coming out?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.”</p>
<p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she did.”</p>
<p>“And what did she say?”</p>
<p>“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as <em>that</em>, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:</p>
<p>“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”</p>
<p>“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”</p>
<p>“And do you like her?”</p>
<p>“Very much.”</p>
<p>“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”</p>
<p>“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”</p>
<p>“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”</p>
<p>“I do not recollect that we did.”</p>
<p>“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.”</p>
<p>“How should you have liked making sermons?”</p>
<p>“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?”</p>
<p>“I <em>have</em> heard from authority, which I thought <em>as good</em>, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”</p>
<p>“You have. Yes, there was something in <em>that</em>; I told you so from the first, you may remember.”</p>
<p>“I <em>did</em> hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.”</p>
<p>“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”</p>
<p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:</p>
<p>“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.”</p>
<p>She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="pgepubid00053">Chapter 53</h2>
<p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.</p>
<p>The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”</p>
<p>“Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Write to me very often, my dear.”</p>
<p>“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to <em>me</em>. They will have nothing else to do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.</p>
<p>“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”</p>
<p>The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.</p>
<p>“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”</p>
<p>“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.”</p>
<p>“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”</p>
<p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.</p>
<p>“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what <em>may</em> happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”</p>
<p>“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”</p>
<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:</p>
<p>“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I <em>should</em> be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of <em>myself</em>, but I dread other people’s remarks.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there <em>with</em> his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come without it.</p>
<p>“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I <em>will</em> leave him to himself.”</p>
<p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.</p>
<p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.</p>
<p>“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you will wait on him of course.”</p>
<p>“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”</p>
<p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.</p>
<p>“’Tis an <em>etiquette</em> I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend <em>my</em> hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.”</p>
<p>“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.”</p>
<p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before <em>they</em> did. As the day of his arrival drew near,—</p>
<p>“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”</p>
<p>“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.</p>
<p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.</p>
<p>“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”</p>
<p>“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.”</p>
<p>“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”</p>
<p>“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.”</p>
<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.</p>
<p>The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.</p>
<p>“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early enough for expectation.”</p>
<p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.</p>
<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.</p>
<p>Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.</p>
<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.</p>
<p>“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”</p>
<p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.</p>
<p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</p>
<p>“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.</p>
<p>He readily agreed to it.</p>
<p>“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People <em>did</em> say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”</p>
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.</p>
<p>“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has <em>some</em> friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.</p>
<p>“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.</p>
<p>“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!”</p>
<p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.</p>
<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.</p>
<p>“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.”</p>
<p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0054"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00054">Chapter 54</h2>
<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.</p>
<p>“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she, “did he come at all?”</p>
<p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</p>
<p>“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him.”</p>
<p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane, take care.”</p>
<p>“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”</p>
<p>“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.”</p>
<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had revived.</p>
<p>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.</p>
<p>His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.</p>
<p>She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.</p>
<p>“If he does not come to me, <em>then</em>,” said she, “I shall give him up for ever.”</p>
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:</p>
<p>“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?”</p>
<p>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!</p>
<p>“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”</p>
<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:</p>
<p>“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”</p>
<p>“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.”</p>
<p>She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.</p>
<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.</p>
<p>“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.</p>
<p>“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>
<p>“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”</p>
<p>“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.”</p>
<p>“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”</p>
<p>“And how impossible in others!”</p>
<p>“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?”</p>
<p>“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make <em>me</em> your confidante.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0055"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00055">Chapter 55</h2>
<p>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”</p>
<p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.</p>
<p>“Can you come to-morrow?”</p>
<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.</p>
<p>He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:</p>
<p>“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”</p>
<p>“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”</p>
<p>“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?”</p>
<p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.</p>
<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”</p>
<p>“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that <em>she</em> would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:</p>
<p>“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go.</p>
<p>“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.</p>
<p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</p>
<p>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.</p>
<p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.</p>
<p>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. <em>Their</em> situation was awkward enough; but <em>hers</em> she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</p>
<p>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.</p>
<p>“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.</p>
<p>“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”</p>
<p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.</p>
<p>“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.</p>
<p>“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.</p>
<p>“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”</p>
<p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.</p>
<p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.</p>
<p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:</p>
<p>“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”</p>
<p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.</p>
<p>“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”</p>
<p>“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!”</p>
<p>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.</p>
<p>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.</p>
<p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>
<p>“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.”</p>
<p>“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for it?”</p>
<p>“It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.”</p>
<p>“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”</p>
<p>“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of <em>my</em> being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”</p>
<p>“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.”</p>
<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.</p>
<p>“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!”</p>
<p>“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”</p>
<p>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.</p>
<p>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0056"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00056">Chapter 56</h2>
<p>One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</p>
<p>They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.</p>
<p>She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,</p>
<p>“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.</p>
<p>“And <em>that</em> I suppose is one of your sisters.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”</p>
<p>“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.</p>
<p>“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”</p>
<p>“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:</p>
<p>“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,</p>
<p>“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.”</p>
<p>“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.</p>
<p>Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.</p>
<p>“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in her face.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—</p>
<p>“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.</p>
<p>“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere <em>you</em> may choose to be, you shall not find <em>me</em> so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I <em>know</em> it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.”</p>
<p>“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”</p>
<p>“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”</p>
<p>“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.”</p>
<p>“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?”</p>
<p>“I never heard that it was.”</p>
<p>“And can you likewise declare, that there is no <em>foundation</em> for it?”</p>
<p>“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. <em>You</em> may ask questions which <em>I</em> shall not choose to answer.”</p>
<p>“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”</p>
<p>“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”</p>
<p>“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But <em>your</em> arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.”</p>
<p>“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”</p>
<p>“But you are not entitled to know <em>mine;</em> nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.”</p>
<p>“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to <em>my daughter</em>. Now what have you to say?”</p>
<p>“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.”</p>
<p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:</p>
<p>“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of <em>his</em> mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”</p>
<p>“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”</p>
<p>“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.”</p>
<p>“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”</p>
<p>“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are equal.”</p>
<p>“True. You <em>are</em> a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.”</p>
<p>“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”</p>
<p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment’s deliberation:</p>
<p>“I am not.”</p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p>
<p>“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”</p>
<p>“I will make no promise of the kind.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.”</p>
<p>“And I certainly <em>never</em> shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make <em>their</em> marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would <em>my</em> refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in <em>his</em> affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”</p>
<p>“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is <em>such</em> a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is <em>her</em> husband, who is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”</p>
<p>“You can <em>now</em> have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered. “You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.”</p>
<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.</p>
<p>“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”</p>
<p>“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”</p>
<p>“You are then resolved to have him?”</p>
<p>“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to <em>you</em>, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”</p>
<p>“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”</p>
<p>“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former <em>were</em> excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”</p>
<p>“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”</p>
<p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</p>
<p>“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”</p>
<p>“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="link2HCH0057"></span></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00057">Chapter 57</h2>
<p>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that <em>his</em> being the intimate friend of Bingley, and <em>her</em> being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set <em>that</em> down as almost certain and immediate, which <em>she</em> had looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>
<p>In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than <em>she</em> could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with <em>one</em>, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</p>
<p>If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</p>
<p>“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.”</p>
<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.</p>
<p>The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.</p>
<p>“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”</p>
<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.</p>
<p>She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,</p>
<p>“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had <em>two</em> daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”</p>
<p>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:</p>
<p>“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even <em>your</em> sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”</p>
<p>“From Mr. Collins! and what can <em>he</em> have to say?”</p>
<p>“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.’</p>
<p>“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’</p>
<p>“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:</p>
<p>“‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.’</p>
<p>“<em>Mr. Darcy</em>, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I <em>have</em> surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at <em>you</em> in his life! It is admirable!”</p>
<p>Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.</p>
<p>“Are you not diverted?”</p>
<p>“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”</p>
<p>“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ <em>That</em> is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be <em>missish</em>, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!”</p>
<p>“Yes—<em>that</em> is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but <em>his</em> perfect indifference, and <em>your</em> pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”</p>
<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too <em>little</em>, she might have fancied too <em>much</em>.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00058">Chapter 58</h2>
<p>Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.</p>
<p>They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:</p>
<p>“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.”</p>
<p>“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.”</p>
<p>“If you <em>will</em> thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your <em>family</em> owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. <em>My</em> affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.</p>
<p>They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who <em>did</em> call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which <em>she</em> had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.</p>
<p>“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of my <em>frankness</em> to believe me capable of <em>that</em>. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.”</p>
<p>“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”</p>
<p>“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.”</p>
<p>“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”</p>
<p>“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.”</p>
<p>“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.”</p>
<p>“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”</p>
<p>Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?”</p>
<p>She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.</p>
<p>“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.”</p>
<p>“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.”</p>
<p>“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.”</p>
<p>“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.”</p>
<p>“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. <em>Your</em> retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with <em>me</em>, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was <em>right</em>, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only <em>child</em>), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to <em>wish</em> at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”</p>
<p>“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”</p>
<p>“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.”</p>
<p>“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after <em>that</em> evening?”</p>
<p>“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.”</p>
<p>“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”</p>
<p>“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”</p>
<p>“Your surprise could not be greater than <em>mine</em> in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive <em>more</em> than my due.”</p>
<p>“My object <em>then</em>,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.”</p>
<p>He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.</p>
<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.</p>
<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.</p>
<p>“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which introduced the discussion of <em>their</em> affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.</p>
<p>“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”</p>
<p>“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.</p>
<p>“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.</p>
<p>“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”</p>
<p>“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”</p>
<p>“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.”</p>
<p>“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00059">Chapter 59</h2>
<p>“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>
<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather <em>knew</em> that she was happy than <em>felt</em> herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a <em>dislike</em> which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>
<p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.</p>
<p>“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”</p>
<p>“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.”</p>
<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.”</p>
<p>“You know nothing of the matter. <em>That</em> is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.”</p>
<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.</p>
<p>“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?”</p>
<p>“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”</p>
<p>“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel <em>more</em> than I ought to do, when I tell you all.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.”</p>
<p>“My dearest sister, now <em>be</em> serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?”</p>
<p>“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”</p>
<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.</p>
<p>“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.</p>
<p>“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s way.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”</p>
<p>“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.”</p>
<p>“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:</p>
<p>“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.”</p>
<p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.</p>
<p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means—that <em>she</em>, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.</p>
<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”</p>
<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.</p>
<p>“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?”</p>
<p>“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my indifference?”</p>
<p>“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”</p>
<p>“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.”</p>
<p>“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to <em>you</em>, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing <em>you</em> unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.</p>
<p>“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”</p>
<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.</p>
<p>“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and <em>would</em> have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”</p>
<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.</p>
<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>
<p>“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”</p>
<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.</p>
<p>“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.”</p>
<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.</p>
<p>“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like <em>your</em> husband quite as well as Jane’s.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?”</p>
<p>“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I <em>had</em> begun.”</p>
<p>“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to <em>you</em> was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”</p>
<p>“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”</p>
<p>“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for <em>your</em> approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike <em>them</em>. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of <em>that</em> when they fall in love.”</p>
<p>“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?”</p>
<p>“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”</p>
<p>“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”</p>
<p>“But I was embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“And so was I.”</p>
<p>“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”</p>
<p>“A man who had felt less, might.”</p>
<p>“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you <em>would</em> have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you <em>would</em> have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. <em>Too much</em>, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.”</p>
<p>“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”</p>
<p>“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?”</p>
<p>“My real purpose was to see <em>you</em>, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”</p>
<p>“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?”</p>
<p>“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.”</p>
<p>“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”</p>
<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s long letter; but now, having <em>that</em> to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:</p>
<p>“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But <em>now</em> suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc.”</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.</p>
<p>“Dear Sir,<br />
“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.</p>
<p>“Yours sincerely, etc.”</p>
<p>Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.</p>
<p>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.</p>
<p>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she <em>did</em> speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00061">Chapter 61</h2>
<p>Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to <em>his</em> easy temper, or <em>her</em> affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.</p>
<p>Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</p>
<p>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.</p>
<p>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:</p>
<p>“My dear Lizzy,<br />
“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.</p>
<p>“Yours, etc.”</p>
<p>As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.</p>
<p>Though Darcy could never receive <em>him</em> at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley’s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to <em>talk</em> of giving them a hint to be gone.</p>
<p>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</p>
<p>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</p>
<p>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a<br />
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by<br />
your equipment.<br />
<br />
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right<br />
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm<br />
<br />
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of<br />
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers<br />
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists<br />
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from<br />
people in all walks of life.<br />
<br />
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br />
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s<br />
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br />
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project<br />
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br />
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.<br />

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br />
Literary Archive Foundation<br />
<br />
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br />
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br />
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br />
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br />
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations<br />
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br />
status with the IRS.<br />
<br />
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br />
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br />
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br />
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br />
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations<br />
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To<br />
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any<br />
particular state visit http://pglaf.org<br />
<br />
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br />
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br />
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br />
approach us with offers to donate.<br />
<br />
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br />
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br />
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br />
<br />
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br />
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other<br />
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.<br />

<p>ГЛАВА I</p>
</div>
<p>Все знают, что молодой человек, располагающий средствами, должен подыскивать себе жену.</p>
<p>Как бы мало ни были известны намерения и взгляды такого человека после того, как он поселился на новом месте, эта истина настолько прочно овладевает умами неподалеку живущих семейств, что на него тут же начинают смотреть как на законную добычу той или другой соседской дочки.</p>
<p>— Дорогой мистер Беннет, — сказала как-то раз миссис Беннет своему мужу, — слышали вы, что Незерфилд-парк наконец больше не будет пустовать?</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет ответил, что он этого не слышал.</p>
<p>— Тем не менее это так, — продолжала она. — Только что заходила миссис Лонг и сообщила мне эту новость!</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет промолчал.</p>
<p>— А хотелось бы вам знать, кто будет нашим новым соседом? — с нетерпением спросила его жена.</p>
<p>— Готов вас выслушать, если вам очень хочется мне об этом сказать.</p>
<p>Большего от него не требовалось.</p>
<p>— Ну так слушайте, мой дорогой, — продолжала миссис Беннет. — Незерфилд, по словам миссис Лонг, снят очень богатым молодым человеком из Северной Англии. В понедельник он приезжал туда в карете, запряженной четверкой лошадей, осмотрел поместье и пришел в такой восторг, что тут же условился обо всем с мистером Моррисом. Он переезжает к Михайлову дню, и уже в конце будущей недели туда приедет кое-кто из его прислуги.</p>
<p>— А как его зовут?</p>
<p>— Бингли.</p>
<p>— Он женат или холост?</p>
<p>— Холост, дорогой, в том-то и дело, что холост! Молодой холостяк с доходом в четыре или пять тысяч в год! Не правда ли, удачный случай для наших девочек?</p>
<p>— Как так? Разве это имеет к ним отношение?</p>
<p>— Дорогой мистер Беннет, — ответила его жена, — сегодня вы просто невыносимы. Разумеется, вы понимаете, что я имею в виду его женитьбу на одной из них.</p>
<p>— Гм, таковы его планы?</p>
<p>— Планы! Боже мой, скажете же вы иной раз! Но ведь может вполне случиться, что он в одну из них влюбится. Поэтому, как только он приедет, вам необходимо будет нанести ему визит.</p>
<p>— Я, признаюсь, не вижу к тому достаточных оснований. Поезжайте-ка вы сами с девочками. Или пошлите их одних — это, возможно, будет еще лучше. Не то вдруг он вздумает влюбиться в вас — ведь вы ничуть не менее привлекательны, чем любая из наших дочек.</p>
<p>— Вы мне льстите, дорогой. Когда-то я и в самом деле была не лишена привлекательности. Но сейчас, увы, я уже не претендую на то, чтобы слыть красавицей. Женщине, у которой пять взрослых дочерей, не следует много думать о собственной красоте.</p>
<p>— В этих обстоятельствах у женщины не часто остается столько красоты, чтобы о ней приходилось особенно много думать.</p>
<p>— Но, мой друг, вам непременно следует навестить мистера Бингли, как только он появится.</p>
<p>— Едва ли я за это возьмусь.</p>
<p>— Но подумайте о наших девочках. Вы только представьте себе, как хорошо одна из них будет устроена. Вот увидите, сэр Уильям и леди Лукас сразу поспешат в Незерфилд. А ради чего, как вы думаете? Уж конечно, ради своей Шарлотты — вы же знаете, они не очень-то любят навещать незнакомых людей. Вы непременно должны поехать — ведь мы сами без этого никак не можем у него побывать.</p>
<p>— Вы чересчур щепетильны. Полагаю, мистер Бингли будет рад вас увидеть. Хотите, я дам вам для него записочку с обещанием выдать за него замуж любую из моих дочек, которая ему больше понравится? Пожалуй, надо будет только замолвить словечко в пользу моей крошки Лиззи.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, вы этого не сделаете. Лиззи ничуть не лучше других ваших дочерей. Я уверена, что она и вполовину не так красива, как Джейн, и гораздо менее добродушна, чем Лидия. Но ей вы почему-то всегда оказываете предпочтение!</p>
<p>— Ни одна из моих дочек ничем особенно не примечательна, — ответил он. — Они столь же глупы и невежественны, как все другие девчонки в этом возрасте. Просто в Лиззи немножко больше толку, чем в ее сестрах.</p>
<p>— Мистер Беннет, как смеете вы так оскорблять ваших собственных детей? Вам доставляет удовольствие меня изводить. Конечно, вам нет никакого дела до моих истерзанных нервов.</p>
<p>— Вы ошибаетесь, моя дорогая. Я давно привык с ними считаться. Ведь они — мои старые друзья. Недаром вы мне толкуете о них не меньше двадцати лет.</p>
<p>— Ах, вы себе даже не представляете, как я страдаю.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, вы все же доживете до того времени, когда в окрестностях появится множество молодых людей с доходом не менее четырех тысяч в год.</p>
<p>— Даже если их будет двадцать, какой в них прок, раз вы все равно отказываетесь к ним ездить?</p>
<p>— Ну, если их будет двадцать, моя дорогая, тогда я, конечно, соберусь да сразу и объеду их всех подряд.</p>
<p>В характере мистера Беннета так затейливо сочетались живость ума и склонность к иронии, замкнутость и взбалмошность, что за двадцать три года совместной жизни жена все еще не сумела к нему приноровиться. Разобраться в ее натуре было намного проще. Она была невежественной женщиной с недостаточной сообразительностью и неустойчивым настроением. Когда она бывала чем-нибудь недовольна, то считала, что у нее не в порядке нервы. Целью ее жизни было выдать дочерей замуж. Единственными ее развлечениями были визиты и новости.</p>
<p></span><span id="id3"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА II</p>
</div>
<p>Мистер Беннет все же одним из первых навестил мистера Бингли. По правде говоря, он с самого начала имел в виду нанести ему визит, хотя все время уверял жену, будто бы ни за что к нему не поедет. И она оставалась в полном неведении относительно его намерений до конца того дня, когда визит состоялся. Истинное положение вещей раскрылось следующим образом. Наблюдая за тем, как его вторая дочь украшает лентами шляпку, мистер Беннет неожиданно заметил:</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, Лиззи, мистеру Бингли это понравится.</p>
<p>— Мы никогда не узнаем, что нравится и что не нравится мистеру Бингли, — с раздражением проговорила ее мать, — раз нам не придется бывать в Незерфилде.</p>
<p>— Но вы забываете, мама, — сказала Элизабет, — что мы встретим его на балу, и миссис Лонг обещала нас познакомить.</p>
<p>— О нет, миссис Лонг ни за что этого не сделает. У нее у самой две племянницы. Терпеть не могу эту ханжу и эгоистку!</p>
<p>— И я тоже, — сказал мистер Беннет. — Как приятно, что в этом важном деле вы от нее не зависите.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет не снизошла до ответа; но, не будучи в силах сдержать свое раздражение, она напустилась на одну из дочерей:</p>
<p>— Ради бога, Китти, перестань так кашлять! Хоть чуточку подумай о моих нервах. Они этого не выдержат.</p>
<p>— Китти у нас ни с чем не считается, — сказал отец. — Вечно она кашляет невпопад.</p>
<p>— Я кашляла не для удовольствия, — обиделась Китти.</p>
<p>— Когда у вас следующий бал, Лиззи?</p>
<p>— Через две недели.</p>
<p>— Ах, вот как, — воскликнула мать. — Значит, миссис Лонг вернется только накануне бала! Как же она нам его представит, если даже не успеет с ним до этого встретиться?</p>
<p>— Тогда, дорогая моя, вы сможете оказаться полезной вашей приятельнице, представив ей мистера Бингли.</p>
<p>— Невозможно, мистер Беннет, невозможно, раз я сама не буду с ним знакома. Вы просто надо мной издеваетесь!</p>
<p>— Ваша осторожность делает вам честь. Конечно, такое недолгое знакомство почти ничего не значит. Какое суждение можно составить о человеке в течение двух недель? Однако, если ее не познакомим с мистером Бингли мы, это сделает кто-нибудь другой. По мне — пускай миссис Лонг и ее племянницы тоже попытают счастья. Я даже готов взять такое доброе дело на себя, если оно вам очень не по душе.</p>
<p>Девицы уставились на отца. Миссис Беннет пробормотала:</p>
<p>— Какой вздор!</p>
<p>— Что означает ваше выразительное замечание, сударыня? — спросил он с удивлением. — Считаете ли вы вздорным обычай, согласно которому, прежде чем иметь дело с незнакомым человеком, он должен быть вам представлен? Или вам не нравится существующий порядок такого представления? Боюсь, наши взгляды в этом отношении слегка расходятся. А ты, Мэри, что думаешь по этому поводу? Ты ведь у нас такая рассудительная девица, читаешь ученые книги и даже делаешь из них выписки.</p>
<p>Мэри хотела сказать что-нибудь глубокомысленное, но ничего не смогла придумать.</p>
<p>— Пока Мэри собирается с мыслями, — продолжал он, — вернемся к мистеру Бингли.</p>
<p>— Не могу больше слышать о мистере Бингли, — заявила жена.</p>
<p>— Жаль, что вы не сказали мне об этом раньше. Знай я это сегодня утром, я бы ни в коем случае к нему не поехал. Экая досада! Но раз уж я у него побывал, боюсь, избежать с ним знакомства будет не так-то легко.</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет добился, чего хотел, — дамы пришли в крайнее изумление. Особенно сильно была поражена миссис Беннет. Однако, когда первый порыв радости миновал, она принялась уверять, что именно этого от него и ждала.</p>
<p>— Вы поступили в самом деле великодушно, мой дорогой мистер Беннет! Хотя, признаюсь, я не сомневалась, что в конце концов добьюсь от вас этого. Я знала, вы настолько любите наших девочек, что не способны пренебречь подобным знакомством. Ах, как я счастлива! И как мило вы над нами подшутили. Подумать только, вы еще утром побывали в Незерфилде и до сих пор даже словом об этом не обмолвились!</p>
<p>— Теперь, Китти, можешь кашлять сколько угодно, — сказал мистер Беннет, выходя из комнаты, чтобы не слышать восторженных излияний своей жены.</p>
<p>— Какой же, девочки, у вас прекрасный отец! — воскликнула она, когда дверь закрылась. — Не знаю, право, чем вы отблагодарите его за такую доброту. Да и меня тоже. Поверьте, в наши годы не так-то приятно каждый день заводить новые знакомства. Но ради своих детей мы готовы на все. Лидия, милочка моя, хоть ты и моложе всех, сдается мне, что танцевать на балу мистер Бингли будет именно с тобой.</p>
<p>— Меня этим не удивишь, — храбро заявила Лидия. — Хоть я и моложе, зато я — самая высокая.</p>
<p>Остаток вечера прошел в рассуждениях о том, через сколько дней следует ожидать ответного визита мистера Бингли и когда после этого его можно будет пригласить на обед.</p>
<p></span><span id="id4"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА III</p>
</div>
<p>Как ни старались миссис Беннет и ее пять дочерей, им все же не удалось добиться от главы семьи такого описания мистера Бингли, которое могло бы удовлетворить их любопытство. Они атаковали мистера Беннета самыми различными способами: вопросами напрямик, хитроумными догадками, отдаленными намеками. Но он не поддавался ни на какие уловки. И в конце концов им пришлось удовольствоваться сведениями из вторых рук, полученными от их соседки, леди Лукас. Сообщения последней были весьма многообещающими. Сэр Уильям был в восторге от мистера Бингли. Он еще очень молод, хорош собой, чрезвычайно любезен и, в довершение всего, выражает намерение непременно присутствовать на ближайшем балу, куда собирается прибыть с целой компанией своих друзей.</p>
<p>Ничего лучшего нельзя было и желать. Кто интересуется танцами, тому ничего не стоит влюбиться. Все питали самые радужные надежды на скорейшее завоевание сердца мистера Бингли.</p>
<p>— Ах, если бы мне довелось увидеть одну из моих дочерей счастливой хозяйкой Незерфилда, — сказала своему мужу миссис Беннет, — и так же удачно выдать замуж остальных — мне бы тогда нечего было больше желать.</p>
<p>Через несколько дней мистер Бингли отдал визит мистеру Беннету и просидел десять минут в его библиотеке. Мистер Бингли надеялся взглянуть на молодых леди, о красоте которых он уже много слышал, но ему удалось повидать только их отца. Дамы были несколько удачливее его: им посчастливилось увидеть из верхнего окна, что на нем был синий сюртук и что он приехал на вороной лошади.</p>
<p>Вскоре после этого было послано приглашение на обед. Миссис Беннет составила уже меню, делавшее честь ее умению вести хозяйство, как вдруг из Незерфилда пришел ответ, расстроивший все планы. Мистеру Бингли необходимо на следующий день уехать в Лондон, что, к величайшему сожалению, лишает его возможности воспользоваться оказанным ему вниманием и т. д. и т. п. Миссис Беннет была крайне разочарована. Она никак не могла представить, что за дела возникли у него в городе так скоро после переезда в Хартфордшир, и начала опасаться, что он вечно будет порхать с места на место и что Незерфилд никогда не станет его постоянным пристанищем. Ее тревога была до некоторой степени рассеяна предположением леди Лукас, что он мог поехать в Лондон за своими друзьями, с которыми собирался появиться на балу. Вскоре стали поговаривать, что на бал вместе с Бингли прибудет двенадцать дам и семь джентльменов. Барышень опечалило число дам, но они несколько ободрились, услышав, что вместо двенадцати спутниц с ним приехали из Лондона только шесть: пять его сестер и одна кузина. Когда незерфилдская компания вступила в бальный зал, обнаружилось, что она состоит всего из пяти человек: мистера Бингли, двух его сестер, мужа старшей сестры и еще одного молодого господина.</p>
<p>Мистер Бингли оказался молодым человеком с благородной и приятной наружностью и непринужденными манерами. Обе сестры его — особами изящными и весьма светскими. Его зять, мистер Хёрст, с трудом мог сойти за дворянина. Зато друг мистера Бингли, мистер Дарси, сразу привлек к себе внимание всего зала своей статной фигурой, правильными чертами лица и аристократической внешностью. Через пять минут после их прихода всем стало известно, что он владелец имения, приносящего десять тысяч фунтов годового дохода. Джентльмены нашли его достойным представителем мужского пола, дамы объявили, что он гораздо привлекательнее мистера Бингли, и в течение первой половины вечера он вызывал всеобщее восхищение. Однако позднее, из-за его поведения, популярность мистера Дарси быстро пошла на убыль. Стали поговаривать, что он слишком горд, что он перед всеми задирает нос и что ему трудно угодить. И уже все его огромное поместье в Дербишире не могло искупить его неприятной и даже отталкивающей наружности. Разумеется, он не выдерживал никакого сравнения со своим другом.</p>
<p>Мистер Бингли вскоре перезнакомился почти со всеми присутствовавшими. Он был оживлен и любезен, участвовал в каждом танце, жалел о слишком раннем окончании бала и даже упомянул вскользь, что не мешало бы устроить бал в Незерфилде. Столь приятные качества говорили сами за себя. Как разительно отличался он от своего друга! Мистер Дарси танцевал только раз с миссис Хёрст и раз с мисс Бингли, не пожелал быть представленным другим дамам и весь остальной вечер провел, прохаживаясь по залу и изредка перекидываясь словами с кем-нибудь из своих спутников. Характер его осудили все. Дарси был признан одним из самых заносчивых и неприятных людей на свете, и все хором выражали надежду на то, что он больше никогда не появится в местном обществе. Среди злейших его противников оказалась миссис Беннет. Разделяемое этой дамой общее неудовольствие поведением мистера Дарси превратилось в личную неприязнь после того, как он отнесся пренебрежительно к одной из ее дочерей.</p>
<p>Из-за недостатка кавалеров Элизабет Беннет была вынуждена в течение двух танцев просидеть у стены. При этом ей невольно пришлось подслушать разговор между мистером Дарси, который стоял неподалеку, и мистером Бингли, на минуту покинувшим танцующих для того, чтобы уговорить своего друга последовать их примеру.</p>
<p>— Пойдемте, Дарси. Я должен заставить вас танцевать, — сказал он, подходя к своему другу. — Не могу смотреть, как вы целый вечер глупейшим образом простаиваете в одиночестве. Право же, пригласите кого-нибудь.</p>
<p>— Ни в коем случае! Вы знаете, танцы не доставляют мне удовольствия, если я не знаком со своей дамой. А в здешнем обществе — это было бы для меня просто невыносимо. Ваши сестры приглашены, а кроме них, в зале нет ни одной женщины, танцевать с которой не было бы для меня сущим наказанием.</p>
<p>— О, я не так привередлив, как вы! — воскликнул Бингли. — Клянусь честью, я еще ни разу не встречал за один вечер так много хорошеньких женщин; среди них есть просто красавицы!</p>
<p>— Вы танцуете с единственной хорошенькой девицей в этом зале, — сказал мистер Дарси, взглянув на старшую мисс Беннет.</p>
<p>— О, это самое очаровательное создание, какое мне когда-нибудь приходилось встречать! Но вон там, за вашей спиной, сидит одна из ее сестер. По-моему, она тоже очень недурна. Хотите, я попрошу мою даму вас познакомить?</p>
<p>— Про кого это вы говорите? — Обернувшись, Дарси взглянул на Элизабет, но, заметив, что она на него смотрит, отвел глаза и холодно сказал: — Что ж, она как будто мила. И все же не настолько хороша, чтобы нарушить мой душевный покой. А у меня сейчас нет охоты утешать молодых леди, которыми пренебрегли другие кавалеры. Возвращайтесь-ка к своей даме. Уверяю вас, вы теряете со мной время, которое могли бы провести, наслаждаясь ее улыбками.</p>
<p>Бингли последовал этому совету, его приятель отошел в другой конец комнаты, а Элизабет осталась на месте, питая не слишком добрые чувства по отношению к Дарси. Впрочем, она с удовольствием рассказала об этом случае в кругу своих друзей, так как обладала веселым нравом и была не прочь посмеяться.</p>
<p>Вся семья провела вечер все же очень приятно. Миссис Беннет была в восторге от внимания, которое обитатели Незерфилда оказали ее старшей дочери. Мистер Бингли танцевал с ней дважды, и она была любезно принята его сестрами. Джейн радовалась этому не меньше матери, хотя и не выражала своего восторга столь явно. Элизабет радовалась за Джейн. Мэри слышала, как кто-то в разговоре с мисс Бингли назвал ее самой начитанной девицей во всей округе; Кэтрин и Лидии посчастливилось ни разу не остаться в танцах без кавалеров — большего от бала они пока не научились желать. Таким образом, все вернулись в Лонгборн<a href="#ref39" class="a" onclick="save();">[1]</a> — селение, в котором они жили и где семейство Беннет занимало видное положение, — в превосходнейшем состоянии духа. Когда они приехали, мистер Беннет еще не спал. За книгой он не замечал времени; на этот же раз ему было весьма любопытно узнать, как прошел вечер, от которого столь многого ожидали его домашние. Он почти не сомневался, что замыслы его жены в отношении их нового знакомого не увенчаются успехом. Однако вскоре он понял, что ему предстоит выслушать рассказ совсем в другом роде.</p>
<p>— О дорогой мистер Беннет, — входя в комнату, воскликнула его жена, — какой вечер мы провели! Бал был великолепен! Жаль только, вас не было. Джейн пользовалась необыкновенным успехом. Все только и говорили, какая она красавица. Мистер Бингли назвал ее очаровательной и танцевал с ней два раза. Вы только подумайте, мой друг, — целых два раза! И она была единственной, кого он приглашал дважды. Сначала он танцевал с мисс Лукас. Меня всю покоробило, когда я увидела его с ней в паре. Но она ему ничуть не понравилась. Да и кому она может понравиться, вы сами знаете! Зато когда стала танцевать Джейн, он как будто весь загорелся. Разузнал, кто она такая, попросил, чтобы его ей представили, и тут же пригласил ее на второй танец. В третьем танце его парой была мисс Кинг, в четвертом — Мария Лукас, в пятом еще раз Джейн, в шестом — Лиззи; буланже<a href="#ref38" class="a" onclick="save();">[2]</a> он танцевал…</p>
<p>— Будь у него ко мне хоть капля сочувствия, — нетерпеливо перебил ее муж, — он бы танцевал вдвое меньше. Ради бога, не перечисляйте больше его дам. Что ему стоило подвернуть ногу при первом танце?</p>
<p>— Ах, дорогой мой, я от него в восторге! — продолжала миссис Беннет. — Он необыкновенно хорош собой! А сестры его — просто очаровательны! Я в жизни не видывала более элегантных нарядов! Думаю, что кружево на платье миссис Хёрст…</p>
<p>Здесь ее речь была снова прервана, так как мистер Беннет не пожелал выслушивать описание туалетов. Поэтому ей пришлось переменить тему, и она возмущенно и с преувеличениями рассказала про неслыханную дерзость мистера Дарси.</p>
<p>— Могу вас заверить, — заключила она, — Лиззи не много потеряла от того, что пришлась ему не по вкусу! Этому противному человеку и нравиться даже не стоит. Такой важный и надутый, недаром его все невзлюбили. Расхаживает туда-сюда, воображая о себе бог весть что! Недостаточно хороша, чтобы с ним танцевать!.. Хотела бы я, чтобы вы были там и осадили его как следует. Терпеть не могу этого человека!</p>

<p>ГЛАВА IV</p>
</div>
<p>Когда Джейн и Элизабет остались одни, Джейн, до того отзывавшаяся о мистере Бингли весьма сдержанно, призналась сестре, насколько он ей понравился.</p>
<p>— Он именно такой, каким должен быть молодой человек, — сказала она, — умный, добрый, веселый. И я никогда еще не видела подобных манер — столько свободы и вместе с тем как чувствуется хорошее воспитание!</p>
<p>— К тому же он недурен собой, — добавила Элизабет, — что также говорит в пользу молодого человека, если к нему это относится. Благодаря этому характер его можно считать вполне совершенным.</p>
<p>— Я была так польщена, когда он пригласил меня танцевать второй раз! Признаюсь, я этого совершенно не ожидала.</p>
<p>— Не ожидала! Зато я ожидала вместо тебя. Знаки внимания каждый раз застигают тебя врасплох, а меня — никогда. В этом — одно из различий между нами. Ну что могло быть естественнее того, что он однажды пригласил тебя танцевать? Разве он не видел, что ты самая красивая девушка в зале? Чего же тут удивляться его галантности? Впрочем, он в самом деле довольно милый молодой человек, и пусть уж он тебе нравится. Тебе не раз нравился кое-кто и похуже.</p>
<p>— Лиззи, дорогая!</p>
<p>— Ты сама знаешь, что слишком склонна расхваливать кого угодно, не замечая ни в ком малейшего изъяна. Все люди кажутся тебе добрыми и красивыми. Ну хоть раз в жизни ты отозвалась о ком-нибудь плохо?</p>
<p>— Мне никого не хотелось бы неосмотрительно осудить. Но ведь я всегда говорю то, что думаю.</p>
<p>— Я знаю. Именно это меня больше всего и удивляет. Как ты, с твоим здравым смыслом, способна не замечать слабостей и глупости окружающих? Наигранное прекраснодушие встречается достаточно часто, чуть ли не на каждом шагу. Но искренне, без всякого притворства или расчета видеть в каждом человеке лишь хорошие качества, к тому же их преувеличивая, и не замечать ничего плохого — на это способна ты одна. Значит, тебе так же понравились и его сестры? Своими манерами они ведь сильно отличаются от мистера Бингли?</p>
<p>— Разумеется, если судить по первому взгляду. Но достаточно с ними немного разговориться, чтобы почувствовать, какие это славные женщины. Мисс Бингли собирается жить с братом и вести его хозяйство. Мне кажется, я не ошибусь, предсказывая, что в ее лице мы приобретем необычайно приятную соседку.</p>
<p>Элизабет выслушала ее молча, но в душе с ней не согласилась. Поведение сестер мистера Бингли на балу отнюдь не было рассчитано на всеобщее одобрение. Обладающая большей, чем Джейн, наблюдательностью, не столь добродушная и не связанная личным чувством, Элизабет не могла ими восторгаться. Мисс Бингли и ее сестра, миссис Хёрст, были в самом деле особами весьма изысканными. Они не были лишены остроумия, когда находились в хорошем расположении духа, умели понравиться, когда это входило в их намерение, но в то же время были заносчивы и высокомерны. Обе они казались довольно красивыми, получили образование в одном из лучших частных пансионов, владели двадцатью тысячами фунтов, расходуя денег больше, чем имели в своем распоряжении, привыкли вращаться в светском обществе, а потому считали себя вправе придерживаться высокого мнения о собственных персонах и низкого — о людях окружающих. Родились они в почтенной семье, происходившей из Северной Англии, — обстоятельство, запечатлевшееся в их памяти более глубоко, чем то, что своим богатством они были обязаны торговле.</p>
<p>Отец мистера Бингли оставил сыну около ста тысяч фунтов. При жизни он собирался приобрести имение, но своей мечты так и не осуществил. Сам мистер Бингли тоже питал в душе такое намерение, и даже как-то ездил с этой целью в родное графство. Но после того, как он обзавелся хорошим домом с прилегающими охотничьими угодьями<a href="#ref37" class="a" onclick="save();">[3]</a>, для многих, знавших его беспечный характер, казалось вероятным, что он всю жизнь проведет в Незерфилде, отложив основание родового поместья Бингли до следующего поколения.</p>
<p>Его сестрам очень хотелось, чтобы он стал землевладельцем. Но хотя пока что он оставался лишь арендатором, мисс Бингли ни в коей мере не отказывалась играть роль хозяйки за его столом. Миссис Хёрст, которая вышла замуж за человека более родовитого, чем богатого, тоже ничего не имела против того, чтобы считать его дом своим, когда ей это представлялось удобным. Про Незерфилд-парк Бингли узнал благодаря случайной рекомендации через два года после своего совершеннолетия. Он обошел дом за полчаса, остался доволен его местоположением и внутренним устройством, а также изложенными хозяином преимуществами имения, и тут же его арендовал.</p>
<p>Несмотря на различие характеров, он был связан с Дарси теснейшей дружбой. Дарси ценил Бингли за его легкую, открытую и податливую натуру, хотя эти качества резко противоречили его собственному нраву, которым сам он отнюдь не был недоволен. Бингли вполне полагался на дружбу Дарси, весьма доверяя его суждениям, более глубоким, чем его собственные. Хотя Бингли вовсе не был недалеким человеком, но Дарси был по-настоящему умен. В то же время Дарси был горд, замкнут и ему было трудно угодить. Его манеры, хотя и свидетельствовали о хорошем воспитании, не слишком располагали к себе окружающих. В этом отношении его друг имел перед ним значительное преимущество. Где бы ни показался Бингли, он сразу вызывал к себе дружеские чувства. Дарси же постоянно всех от себя отталкивал.</p>
<p>Отношение каждого к меритонскому балу было достаточно характерным. Бингли в жизни своей еще не встречал столь милого общества и таких очаровательных женщин; все были к нему добры и внимательны, он не ощущал никакой натянутости и вскоре близко сошелся со всеми, кто находился в зале. Что же касается мисс Беннет, то он не мог себе представить более прелестного ангела. Дарси, напротив, видел вокруг себя толпу людей довольно безобразных и совершенно безвкусных, к которым он не испытывал ни малейшего интереса и со стороны которых не замечал ни внимания, ни расположения. Он признавал, что мисс Беннет недурна собой, но находил, что она чересчур много улыбается.</p>
<p>Миссис Хёрст и ее сестра готовы были согласиться с такой характеристикой мисс Беннет, но все же Джейн им понравилась и они объявили, что она премиленькая девочка и что они ничего не имеют против того, чтобы поддерживать с ней знакомство. Мисс Беннет так и осталась премиленькой девочкой, в соответствии с чем мистеру Бингли было дозволено относиться к ней, как ему заблагорассудится.</p>
<p></span><span id="id6"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА V</p>
</div>
<p>Неподалеку от Лонгборна жила семья, с которой Беннеты поддерживали особенно близкие отношения. Сэр Уильямс Лукас ранее занимался торговлей в Меритоне, где приобрел некоторое состояние, а также титул баронета, пожалованный ему в бытность его мэром, благодаря специальному обращению к королю. Последнее отличие подействовало на него, пожалуй, слишком сильно. Оно породило в нем неприязнь к прежнему образу жизни и занятиям в небольшом торговом городке. Расставшись с тем и другим, он перебрался со своей семьей в дом, расположенный в одной миле от Меритона, который с той поры стал именоваться «Лукас Лодж»<a href="#ref36" class="a" onclick="save();">[4]</a>. Здесь сэр Уильям, не будучи обременен никакими делами, мог с удовольствием предаваться размышлениям о собственной значительности и проявлять предупредительность по отношению ко всему свету. В самом деле, хотя полученное звание и возвеличило его в собственных глазах, оно все же не сделало его высокомерным. Напротив, сэр Уильямс был воплощением любезности и внимательности к каждому встречному, так как представление ко двору в Сент-Джеймсе<a href="#ref34" class="a" onclick="save();">[5]</a> сделало этого по природе безобидного и дружелюбного человека еще и обходительным.</p>
<p>Леди Лукас была добродушной женщиной, в меру недалекой, чтобы стать подходящей соседкой для миссис Беннет. У нее было несколько детей. Старшая дочь, смышленая и начитанная девушка лет двадцати семи, была большой подругой Элизабет.</p>
<p>Барышни Лукас и барышни Беннет неизбежно должны были встретиться, чтобы поговорить о бале. И на следующее утро первые оказались в Лонгборне, готовые слушать и рассказывать.</p>
<p>— Для вас, Шарлотта, вечер начался неплохо, — обратилась миссис Беннет к мисс Лукас. — Ведь первый танец мистер Бингли танцевал с вами.</p>
<p>— Да, но он был больше доволен своей дамой во втором танце.</p>
<p>— Вы говорите это, потому что он пригласил Джейн еще раз? Что ж, он и впрямь вел себя так, будто она ему приглянулась. Я даже кое-что слышала по этому поводу — не помню подробностей, — что-то в связи с мистером Робинсоном.</p>
<p>— Быть может, вы имеете в виду его разговор с мистером Робинсоном, который я случайно подслушала? Разве я вам его не передала? Когда мистер Робинсон спрашивал его — нравится ли ему наше общество, не находит ли он, что в зале собралось много хорошеньких женщин и которая из них кажется ему самой красивой, он сразу же ответил на последний вопрос: «О, разумеется, старшая мисс Беннет! Тут даже не может быть двух мнений!»</p>
<p>— Честное слово, сказано довольно решительно. Можно подумать, что… Но вы знаете — все может кончиться ничем.</p>
<p>— Не правда ли, я была более удачливой шпионкой, чем ты, Элиза? — сказала Шарлотта. — Мистер Дарси говорит менее приятные вещи, чем его друг. Бедная Элиза! Ты, оказывается, всего лишь «как будто мила»!</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, вы не станете вбивать Лиззи в голову, что она должна быть задета его словами? Понравиться такому несносному человеку было бы просто несчастьем. Миссис Лонг сказала вчера, что он просидел около нее полчаса кряду и за все время даже не раскрыл рта.</p>
<p>— Уверены ли вы в этом? — спросила Джейн. — Нет ли тут какого-то недоразумения? Я хорошо видела, как мистер Дарси с ней разговаривал.</p>
<p>— Пустяки! Она его под конец спросила — понравился ли ему Незерфилд. Вот ему и пришлось что-то ответить. По ее словам, Дарси сделал это весьма неохотно.</p>
<p>— Мисс Бингли сказала мне, — заметила Джейн, — что он терпеть не может подолгу беседовать с посторонними. Зато с близкими друзьями он держится необыкновенно приветливо.</p>
<p>— Вот уж не поверю здесь ни единому слову, дорогая. Если бы он умел быть приветливым, он бы поговорил с миссис Лонг. В чем тут дело, мне совершенно ясно: он лопается от гордости, а тут до него как-то дошло, что у миссис Лонг нет экипажа и что на бал она прикатила в наемной карете.</p>
<p>— Меня мало трогает, что Дарси не беседовал с миссис Лонг, — сказала Шарлотта. — Но мне жаль, что он отказался танцевать с Элизой.</p>
<p>— На твоем месте, Лиззи, — сказала мать, — в следующий раз я бы сама отказалась принять его приглашение.</p>
<p>— Думаю, что я могу обещать вам никогда с ним не танцевать.</p>
<p>— Признаюсь, — сказала мисс Лукас, — гордость мистера Дарси задевает меня не так сильно, как чья-либо другая. У него для гордости достаточные основания. Приходится ли удивляться, что столь выдающийся молодой человек, знатный и богатый, придерживается высокого мнения о своей особе. Он, если можно так сказать, имеет право быть гордым.</p>
<p>— Все это так, — ответила Элизабет. — И я бы охотно простила ему его гордость, если бы он не ранил мою.</p>
<p>— Гордость, — вмешалась Мэри, всегда отличавшаяся глубиною суждений, — представляется мне весьма распространенным недостатком. Во всех прочитанных мной книгах говорится, что человеческая природа ей очень подвержена. Весьма немногие среди нас не лелеют в своей душе чувства самодовольства, связанного с какой-то действительной или мнимой чертой характера, которая выделила бы их среди окружающих. Гордость и тщеславие — разные вещи, хотя этими словами часто пользуются как синонимами. Человек может быть гордым, не будучи тщеславным. Гордость скорее связана с нашим собственным о себе мнением, тщеславие же — с мнением других людей, которое нам бы хотелось, чтобы они составили о нас.</p>
<p>— Если б я был так же богат, как мистер Дарси, — воскликнул юный Лукас, который приехал в Лонгборн вместе с сестрами, — я бы не стал особенно важничать, а завел бы себе свору борзых да откупоривал каждый день по бутылочке вина!</p>
<p>— Ты бы при этом выпивал гораздо больше вина, чем следует, — возразила миссис Беннет. — И если бы я застала тебя за этим занятием, я бы отобрала у тебя бутылку.</p>
<p>Мальчик стал с ней спорить, утверждая, что она не осмелилась бы этого сделать, но она настаивала на своем, и спор прекратился только с отъездом гостей.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА VI</p>
</div>
<p>Лонгборнские леди вскоре навестили незерфилдских дам. Визит был должным образом возвращен. Приятные манеры старшей мисс Беннет расположили в ее пользу миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли. И хотя мамаша была признана невыносимой, а о младших дочках не стоило и говорить, двум старшим дали понять, что с ними желали бы поддерживать более близкое знакомство. Такое внимание очень обрадовало Джейн. Но Элизабет, все еще чувствовавшая их высокомерное отношение ко всему местному обществу, в том числе, пожалуй, даже к ее сестре, приняла его довольно холодно, считая, что некоторая доброжелательность миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли к Джейн, по всей вероятности, проистекает из склонности к ней мистера Бингли. В самом деле, эта склонность бросалась в глаза всякому, кто видел их вместе. Для Элизабет было также очевидно, что увлечение Джейн мистером Бингли, возникшее с самого начала их знакомства, становится все более сильным и что в скором времени она будет по уши в него влюблена. Элизабет, однако, с удовлетворением замечала, что эта влюбленность станет не скоро известна посторонним, так как большую силу чувства Джейн сочетала с таким самообладанием и приветливостью, которые должны были защитить ее от подозрений излишне любопытных знакомых. Она поделилась этим наблюдением со своей подругой мисс Лукас.</p>
<p>— Быть может, это неплохо, — сказала Шарлотта, — настолько владеть собой, чтобы в подобных обстоятельствах не выдавать своих чувств. Однако в этой способности может таиться и некоторая опасность. Если женщина скрывает увлечение от своего избранника, она рискует не сохранить его за собой. И тогда слабым утешением для нее будет сознавать, что мир остался в таком же неведении. Почти всякая привязанность в какой-то степени держится на благодарности или тщеславии, и пренебрегать ими вовсе не безопасно. Слегка увлечься все мы готовы совершенно бескорыстно — небольшая склонность вполне естественна. Но мало найдется людей настолько великодушных, чтобы любить без всякого поощрения. В девяти случаях из десяти женщине лучше казаться влюбленной сильнее, чем это есть на самом деле. Бингли несомненно нравится твоя сестра. И тем не менее все может кончиться ничем, если она не поможет ему продвинуться дальше.</p>
<p>— Но она помогает ему настолько, насколько допускает ее характер. Неужели он так ненаблюдателен, что не замечает склонности, которая мне кажется очевидной.</p>
<p>— Не забывай, Элиза, что характер Джейн известен ему не так хорошо, как тебе.</p>
<p>— Но если женщина неравнодушна к мужчине и не пытается подавить в себе это чувство, должен же он это заметить?</p>
<p>— Возможно, — если только он проводит с ней достаточно много времени. Но хоть Бингли и Джейн видятся довольно часто, они никогда не остаются подолгу наедине. А встречаясь в обществе, они, конечно, не могут все время разговаривать только друг с другом. Поэтому Джейн должна использовать как можно лучше каждый час, в течение которого она располагает его вниманием. Когда сердце его будет завоевано, у нее останется сколько угодно времени для того, чтобы влюбиться в него самой.</p>
<p>— Неплохой план, — ответила Элизабет, — для тех, кто ищет только, как бы побыстрей выйти замуж. И если бы я задумала приобрести богатого мужа или вообще какого-нибудь мужа, я бы, наверно, им воспользовалась. Но чувства Джейн совершенно иного рода. Она не строит расчетов. До сих пор она еще не уверена ни в силе своей привязанности, ни в том, насколько она разумна. С тех пор, как они познакомились, прошло всего две недели. Она протанцевала с ним два танца в Меритоне, затем видела его в течение одного утра в Незерфилде. После того они еще четыре раза вместе обедали в большой компании. Этого недостаточно, чтобы она смогла изучить его характер.</p>
<p>— Конечно, нет, если смотреть на все, как ты смотришь. Если она только обедала с ним, она может судить лишь о его аппетите. Но ты забываешь, что они при этом провели вместе четыре вечера. А четыре вечера могут значить очень многое.</p>
<p>— Да, эти четыре вечера позволили им установить, что оба они игру в «двадцать одно» предпочитают игре в покер. Боюсь, однако, что другие не менее важные черты характера успели им раскрыться гораздо меньше.</p>
<p>— Что ж, — сказала Шарлотта, — желаю Джейн успеха от всего сердца. И выйди она за него замуж хоть завтра, я бы считала, что она располагает теми же шансами на счастливую жизнь, как если бы изучала характер своего будущего мужа целый год. Удача в браке полностью зависит от игры случая. Как бы хорошо ни были известны сторонам обоюдные склонности и как бы хорошо они на первый взгляд между собой ни сочетались, — это никак не сказывается на счастье супругов. Со временем между ними возникнет неминуемый разлад, и им выпадут все положенные на их долю огорчения. И не лучше ли в таком случае как можно меньше знать недостатки человека, с которым придется провести жизнь?</p>
<p>— Тебе хочется вызвать меня на спор, Шарлотта. Но твои рассуждения — чистейший вздор. Ты понимаешь это сама. Едва ли ты руководствовалась бы ими в собственной жизни.</p>
<p>Приглядываясь к отношениям между мистером Бингли и Джейн, Элизабет была далека от мысли, что с некоторых пор стала сама предметом пристального наблюдения со стороны его приятеля. Мистер Дарси вначале едва допускал, что она недурна собой. Он совершенно равнодушно смотрел на нее на балу. И когда они встретились в следующий раз, он видел в ней одни недостатки. Но лишь только он вполне доказал себе и своим друзьям, что в ее лице нет ни одной правильной черты, как вдруг стал замечать, что оно кажется необыкновенно одухотворенным благодаря прекрасному выражению темных глаз. За этим открытием последовали и другие, не менее рискованные. Несмотря на то, что своим придирчивым оком он обнаружил не одно отклонение от идеала в ее наружности, он все же был вынужден признать ее необыкновенно привлекательной. И хотя он утверждал, что поведение Элизабет отличается от принятого в светском обществе, оно подкупало его своей живой непосредственностью. Элизабет ничего об этом не знала. Для нее мистер Дарси по-прежнему оставался лишь человеком, который всем был не по душе и который считал ее не настолько красивой, чтобы он мог с ней танцевать.</p>
<p>У Дарси появилось желание познакомиться с ней поближе, и для того, чтобы найти повод для разговора с Элизабет, он стал прислушиваться к ее разговорам с другими людьми. Эти маневры обратили на себя ее внимание. Произошло это в гостях у сэра Уильяма Лукаса, у которого собралось в тот день большое общество.</p>
<p>— Зачем мистеру Дарси понадобилось подслушивать мой разговор с полковником Форстером? — спросила она у Шарлотты.</p>
<p>— На этот вопрос может ответить только сам мистер Дарси.</p>
<p>— Если он себе позволит это еще раз, я непременно дам ему понять, что замечаю его уловки. У него очень насмешливые глаза, и, если я сама не буду с ним достаточно дерзкой, я стану его побаиваться.</p>
<p>Как раз в этот момент мистер Дарси приблизился к ним, не обнаруживая, впрочем, желания вступить в разговор, и мисс Лукас принялась подзадоривать подругу, чтобы она осуществила свое намерение. Вызов подействовал, и Элизабет, обернувшись к нему, спросила:</p>
<p>— Не показалось ли вам, мистер Дарси, что, убеждая сейчас полковника Форстера дать бал в Меритоне, я привела достаточно веские доводы.</p>
<p>— Вы говорили с большим жаром. Впрочем, какая леди не воспламенится от подобной темы!</p>
<p>— О, вы к нам слишком суровы.</p>
<p>— Ну, а теперь не попробовать ли нам убедить и тебя, — сказала мисс Лукас. — Я открываю инструмент, Элиза, и ты знаешь, что за этим должно последовать.</p>
<p>— Странная ты подруга, Шарлотта, всегда заставляешь меня играть и петь перед любым и каждым. Если бы мне вздумалось прослыть выдающейся артисткой, ты была бы просто незаменима. Но ведь я к этому не стремлюсь. Право же, я лучше не стану утруждать слух тех, кому знакомы в самом деле хорошие исполнители.</p>
<p>Однако когда мисс Лукас начала настаивать, она сказала:</p>
<p>— Ну что ж, чему быть — того не миновать! — И, хмуро глядя на мистера Дарси, добавила: — В наших краях помнят еще старое правило: чем сказать, лучше смолчать. Видно, уж надо мне смириться, да тем и кончить дело.</p>
<p>Пела она приятно, хоть и не особенно мастерски. После одной или двух песенок, еще до того, как она смогла что-то ответить слушателям, просившим о повторении, ее оттеснила от фортепьяно сестра Мэри — единственная в семье дурнушка, которая усиленно занималась самоусовершенствованием и всегда была рада себя показать.</p>
<p>У Мэри не было ни таланта, ни вкуса. И хотя тщеславие сделало ее усидчивой, оно в то же время внушило ей такие педантично-самодовольные манеры, которые повредили бы и более мастерскому исполнению. Простое и безыскусное пение Элизабет, хотя и менее совершенное, понравилось публике гораздо больше. Поэтому после затянувшегося концерта Мэри была рада заслужить аплодисменты, играя шотландские и ирландские песенки по просьбе младших сестер, которые вместе с сестрами Лукас и двумя или тремя офицерами затеяли в другом конце комнаты танцы.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси находился от них неподалеку, негодуя по поводу такого препровождения времени, которое исключало возможность разумной беседы. Он был слишком поглощен своими мыслями, чтобы заметить подошедшего сэра Уильяма Лукаса, пока последний не обратился к нему со словами:</p>
<p>— Не правда ли, какое это прекрасное развлечение для молодежи, мистер Дарси! В самом деле, может ли быть что-нибудь приятнее танцев? Я нахожу, что танцы — одно из высших достижений цивилизованного общества.</p>
<p>— Совершенно верно, сэр. И в то же время они весьма распространены в обществе, не тронутом цивилизацией. Плясать умеет всякий дикарь.</p>
<p>Сэр Уильям улыбнулся.</p>
<p>— Ваш друг танцует просто превосходно, — продолжал он после некоторой паузы, увидев, что к танцующим присоединился мистер Бингли. — Не сомневаюсь, что и вы, мистер Дарси, могли бы поразить нас своим искусством.</p>
<p>— Вы, вероятно, видели, сэр, как я танцевал в Меритоне.</p>
<p>— Вы угадали, — и получил при этом немалое удовольствие! Вам часто приходится танцевать в Сент-Джеймсе?</p>
<p>— Никогда, сэр.</p>
<p>— Разве вы не находите это подходящим способом выразить свое уважение королевской фамилии?</p>
<p>— Я ни одной фамилии не выражаю своего уважения подобным способом, если могу этого избежать.</p>
<p>— У вас, должно быть, есть в столице собственный дом?</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси кивнул.</p>
<p>— Одно время я тоже подумывал о том, чтобы переселиться в Лондон, — я так люблю хорошее общество! Но, признаться, я побаиваюсь, как бы лондонский воздух не оказался вреден для леди Лукас.</p>
<p>Он замолчал, дожидаясь ответа. Его собеседник, однако, не был расположен продолжать разговор. В эту минуту к ним приблизилась Элизабет, и сэру Уильяму пришла в голову мысль проявить галантность.</p>
<p>— Как, дорогая мисс Элиза, вы не танцуете? Мистер Дарси, я буду крайне польщен, если по моему совету вы пригласите эту очаровательную юную леди. Не правда ли, вы не сможете отказаться танцевать, когда перед вами находится олицетворение красоты. — И, схватив руку Элизабет, он хотел было уже соединить ее с рукой мистера Дарси, который, несколько растерявшись от неожиданности, был, однако, не прочь этим воспользоваться. Внезапно Элизабет отпрянула назад и, обратившись к сэру Уильяму, с неудовольствием воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Уверяю вас, сэр, я совершенно не предполагала принять участие в танцах. Право, я была бы очень огорчена, если бы вы подумали, что я подошла к вам, желая найти себе кавалера.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси серьезно и учтиво стал просить Элизабет оказать ему честь, приняв его приглашение; но тщетно — она твердо стояла на своем, и делу также не помогла попытка уговорить ее, предпринятая сэром Уильямом.</p>
<p>— Вы превосходно танцуете, мисс Элиза, и с вашей стороны просто жестоко лишить меня такого приятнейшего зрелища. И хотя этот джентльмен — небольшой любитель танцев, у него, конечно, не может быть возражений против того, чтобы так легко оказать нам столь большую услугу.</p>
<p>— Мистер Дарси — сама любезность! — улыбаясь, сказала Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Разумеется, это так. Но, принимая во внимание его побуждения, дорогая мисс Элиза, этому нельзя удивляться. Кто не был бы счастлив танцевать в паре с такой очаровательной дамой?</p>
<p>Элизабет отошла от них с лукавой усмешкой. Ее отказ не повредил ей в глазах мистера Дарси, и он размышлял о ней вполне благожелательно, когда к нему обратилась мисс Бингли:</p>
<p>— Хотите, я угадаю, о чем вы задумались?</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, вам это не удастся.</p>
<p>— Вы думаете, как невыносимо будет проводить таким образом много вечеров, один за другим, — в подобном обществе. И я совершенно с вами согласна. В жизни еще не испытывала такой скуки! Лезут из кожи вон, чтобы себя показать! Сколько в этих людях ничтожества и в то же время самодовольства. Чего бы я ни дала, чтобы услышать, как вы о них будете потом рассказывать.</p>
<p>— На этот раз, поверьте, вы не угадали. Я размышлял о гораздо более приятных вещах: скажем, о том, сколько очарования заключается в красивых глазах на лице хорошенькой женщины.</p>
<p>Мисс Бингли уставилась на него, требуя, чтобы он открыл ей, что за леди удостоилась чести навести его на подобные мысли. Ничуть не смутившись, мистер Дарси ответил:</p>
<p>— Мисс Элизабет Беннет.</p>
<p>— Мисс Элизабет Беннет? — повторила мисс Бингли. — Признаюсь, я поражена до глубины души! Давно ли она пользуется такой благосклонностью? И скоро ли разрешите пожелать вам счастья?</p>
<p>— Именно тот вопрос, которого я от вас ожидал. Какой стремительностью обладает женское воображение! Оно перескакивает от простого одобрения к любви и от любви к браку в одну минуту. Я так и знал, что вы мне пожелаете счастья.</p>
<p>— Что ж, если вы говорите серьезно, я буду считать дело решенным. У вас будет очаровательная теща, которая, конечно, поселится с вами в Пемберли.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси слушал с совершенным безразличием, как она развлекалась подобным образом. И поскольку его спокойствие убедило ее, что на самом деле тревожиться не из-за чего, она продолжала изощряться в такого рода остроумии еще достаточно долго.</p>

<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА VII</p>
</div>
<p>Почти вся собственность мистера Беннета заключалась в имении, приносившем две тысячи фунтов годового дохода. На беду его дочерей, имение это наследовалось по мужской линии и, так как в семье не было ребенка мужского пола, переходило после смерти мистера Беннета к дальнему родственнику. Средства миссис Беннет, достаточные при ее теперешнем положении, ни в коей мере не могли восполнить возможную утрату имения в будущем. Отец ее при жизни был стряпчим в Меритоне, оставив ей всего четыре тысячи фунтов.</p>
<p>Ее сестра вышла замуж за мистера Филипса — бывшего клерка отца, который унаследовал его контору. Брат миссис Беннет жил в Лондоне, будучи занят в солидном торговом деле.</p>
<p>Селение Лонгборн находилось всего в одной миле от Меритона — расстоянии, весьма удобном для девиц Беннет, которые обычно наведывались туда три-четыре раза в неделю, чтобы оказать знаки внимания тетушке, а заодно и расположенной по пути модной лавке. Особенно часто подобные вылазки совершались двумя младшими дочерьми, Кэтрин и Лидией. Наиболее легкомысленные из сестер, они, за неимением лучшего, непременно должны были побывать в Меритоне, чтобы развлечься после завтрака и запастись новостями для болтовни перед сном. И как бы округа ни была бедна происшествиями, у тетушки им всегда удавалось разузнать нечто достойное их внимания. В настоящее время они не терпели недостатка в новостях благодаря расположившемуся на зиму в окрестностях Меритона полку милиции<a href="#ref32" class="a" onclick="save();">[6]</a>, офицеры которого были расквартированы в городке.</p>
<p>Теперь при посещении миссис Филипс выяснялось множество любопытных подробностей. Каждый день приносил новые сведения об именах офицеров и отношениях между ними. Квартиры офицеров недолго оставались неизвестными, и вскоре стали завязываться знакомства с их обитателями. Мистер Филипс навестил каждого из офицеров и тем самым открыл для своих племянниц новый источник блаженства, несравнимого с прежними радостями жизни. Они не могли разговаривать ни о чем, кроме офицеров. И даже все состояние мистера Бингли, любое упоминание о котором так волновало их мать, не стоило в их глазах ни гроша по сравнению с мундиром прапорщика.</p>
<p>Наслушавшись однажды подобной болтовни, мистер Беннет как бы между прочим заметил:</p>
<p>— Из ваших рассуждений я понял, что вы можете считаться двумя самыми глупыми девчонками в королевстве. Подобная мысль приходила мне в голову и раньше. Но теперь я в этом окончательно убедился.</p>
<p>Кэтрин смутилась и замолчала, но Лидия, не обратив на эти слова внимания, продолжала рассказывать, как она восхищена капитаном Картером и как ей хочется еще раз его увидеть, прежде чем он завтра уедет в Лондон.</p>
<p>— Меня удивляет, дорогой мой, — сказала миссис Беннет, — с каким пренебрежением судите вы о развитии ваших детей. Если бы я усомнилась в достоинствах чьих-либо детей, то, уж во всяком случае, не своих собственных.</p>
<p>— Если мои дети глупы, мне хотелось бы, по крайней мере, не питать в отношении их напрасных надежд.</p>
<p>— К счастью, они необыкновенно умны!</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, мы расходимся с вами только в этом вопросе. Было бы приятнее, если бы наши взгляды полностью совпадали. Но пока, увы, я нахожу, что две наши младшие дочки — препорядочные дуры.</p>
<p>— Дорогой мистер Беннет, нельзя требовать от юных девиц, чтобы они были так же умны, как их отец и мать. В нашем возрасте они, наверно, будут думать об офицерах не больше, чем мы с вами. Я хорошо помню время, когда мне самой очень нравились красные мундиры, — в глубине души, признаюсь, я и теперь к ним неравнодушна. И если бы какой-нибудь обаятельный молодой полковник с шестью тысячами в год попросил руки моей дочери, уверяю вас, я не смогла бы ему отказать. Позавчера вечером у сэра Уильяма мне так понравился полковник Форстер в его парадной форме!</p>
<p>— Ах, мама! — воскликнула Лидия. — Тетя говорит, что полковник Форстер и капитан Картер уже не так часто бывают у мисс Уотсон. Теперь она их чаще видит в библиотеке Кларка.</p>
<p>Ответу миссис Беннет помешало появление посыльного с письмом для ее старшей дочери. Письмо было послано из Незерфилда, и слуга, который его принес, ждал ответа. Глаза миссис Беннет заблестели от радости, и, пока Джейн проглядывала письмо, она забросала дочь нетерпеливыми вопросами:</p>
<p>— Ах, Джейн, от кого оно? Что там такое? Что он тебе написал? Скорее, скорее, Джейн! Говори же, милочка!</p>
<p>— Оно от мисс Бингли, — сказала Джейн и прочла вслух:</p>
<p>«Моя дорогая, если Вы не согласитесь из жалости к нам пообедать сегодня вместе со мной и Луизой, мы можем возненавидеть друг друга на веки веков, так как пребывание двух женщин tete-a-tete в течение целого дня никогда не обходится без ссоры. Приезжайте как можно скорее. Мой брат и его друзья обедают с офицерами.</p>
<p><em>Вечно Ваша</em></p>
<p><em>Кэролайн Бингли».</em></p>
<p>— С офицерами! — воскликнула Лидия. — Как же тетя об этом ничего не сказала?</p>
<p>— Обедают в другом месте? — сказала миссис Беннет. — Какая досада!</p>
<p>— Могу я воспользоваться коляской? — спросила Джейн.</p>
<p>— Нет, дорогая, поезжай лучше верхом. Собирается дождь, и тебе там придется переночевать.</p>
<p>— Неплохо придумано! — сказала Элизабет. — Если только вы уверены, что ее не отвезут домой сами хозяева.</p>
<p>— Но ведь карета мистера Бингли будет с мужчинами в Меритоне. А у Хёрстов вовсе нет лошадей.</p>
<p>— Мне все же хотелось бы поехать в коляске.</p>
<p>— Милочка, я уверена, что папа не сможет дать лошадей. Они нужны для работы на ферме, не правда ли, мистер Беннет?</p>
<p>— Лошади нужны для работы на ферме гораздо чаще, чем их удается для этого получить!</p>
<p>— Если вы используете их там сегодня, мама будет довольна, — сказала Элизабет.</p>
<p>В конце концов от отца добились подтверждения того, что лошади заняты. Джейн должна была поэтому ехать верхом, и мать проводила ее до ворот, с довольным видом предсказывая ухудшение погоды. Надежды эти вполне оправдались: не успела Джейн выехать, как начался проливной дождь, который привел в беспокойство ее сестер и чрезвычайно обрадовал мать. Дождь продолжался весь вечер без перерыва, так что о возвращении Джейн не могло быть и речи.</p>
<p>— Как хорошо я придумала! — не раз восклицала миссис Беннет, как будто она не только предсказала, но сама и вызвала ухудшение погоды. Однако только на следующее утро она смогла полностью оценить великолепие своего замысла. Завтрак подходил к концу, когда из Незерфилда прибыл слуга со следующей запиской, адресованной Элизабет:</p>
<p>«Дорогая Лиззи, сегодня утром я очень плохо себя почувствовала — должно быть, оттого, что вчера основательно промокла. Наши добрые друзья и слышать не хотят о моем возвращении, пока я слегка не поправлюсь. Они настаивают также на том, чтобы меня осмотрел мистер Джонс, — поэтому не тревожьтесь, если услышите, что он меня навестил. У меня всего только головная боль и небольшое воспаление в горле.</p>
<p><em>Твоя и т. д.».</em></p>
<p>— Что ж, моя дорогая, — обратился к жене мистер Беннет, когда Элизабет прочла записку вслух, — если ваша дочь серьезно заболеет и, быть может, умрет, — каким утешением будет сознавать, что произошло это в погоне за мистером Бингли, осуществленной по вашим указаниям.</p>
<p>— Я не опасаюсь за ее жизнь. От простуды не умирают! За ней будут хорошо ухаживать, и, пока она там, ничего плохого с ней не случится. Если бы можно было взять экипаж, я бы ее навестила.</p>
<p>По-настоящему встревоженная Элизабет решила проведать сестру. И так как экипажа не было, а ездить верхом она не умела, ей не оставалось ничего другого, как отправиться в Незерфилд пешком. Она объявила об этом намерении.</p>
<p>— Ты с ума сошла, — воскликнула мать, — идти пешком по такой грязи! Да на тебя смотреть нельзя будет, когда ты туда явишься.</p>
<p>— Зато я смогу присмотреть за Джейн, а это все, что мне нужно.</p>
<p>— Может быть, Лиззи, все же послать за лошадьми? — спросил отец.</p>
<p>— Нет, право, не нужно. Я даже буду рада пройтись. Расстояния не замечаешь, если перед тобой определенная цель. Да тут и всего-то каких-нибудь три мили. К обеду я буду дома.</p>
<p>— Восхищаюсь твоей готовностью помогать ближнему, — сказала Мэри. — Но каждый душевный порыв следует поверять разумом. Во всяком деле, мне думается, нужно прилагать силу, соразмерную необходимому действию.</p>
<p>— Хочешь, дойдем вместе до Меритона? — предложили Кэтрин и Лидия.</p>
<p>Элизабет согласилась, и три девицы вышли из дома одновременно.</p>
<p>— Если мы поспешим, — сказала по дороге Лидия, — мы, быть может, еще застанем капитана Картера перед отъездом.</p>
<p>В Меритоне они расстались. Младшие сестры отправились к жене одного из офицеров, а Элизабет быстро зашагала вперед, пересекая одно поле за другим, торопливо перебираясь через насыпи и прыгая через канавы, пока не оказалась перед Незерфилдом, усталая, в забрызганных грязью чулках и с пылающим от напряженной ходьбы лицом.</p>
<p>Ее провели в комнату для завтрака, где собралось незерфилдское общество за исключением Джейн. Приходу Элизабет все были немало удивлены. Сестрам мистера Бингли казалось просто невероятным, что она могла пройти в такую рань, при такой погоде да еще в полном одиночестве целых три мили пешком. И хотя она была принята весьма любезно, Элизабет понимала, что в их глазах поступок ее не заслуживал одобрения. В поведении мистера Бингли, напротив, можно было заметить признаки чего-то большего, чем простая любезность. В нем чувствовалось расположение и признательность. Мистер Дарси был немногословен, а мистер Хёрст вообще не сказал ничего. Первый размышлял о том, насколько она похорошела, разгоряченная быстрой ходьбой, и в какой мере ее побуждения оправдывали столь смелую прогулку. Мысли второго были целиком сосредоточены на завтраке.</p>
<p>Сведения о состоянии здоровья Джейн были мало утешительны. Мисс Беннет провела тревожную ночь и, хотя встала с постели, чувствовала себя настолько плохо, что не смогла выйти из комнаты. По просьбе Элизабет ее немедленно провели к больной. Приход сестры очень обрадовал Джейн, которая не написала, насколько ей хотелось бы ее повидать, только из опасения вызвать чрезмерную тревогу. Однако она почти не могла говорить и, когда мисс Бингли оставила их вдвоем, сумела только выразить благодарность за необычайную доброту, с которой о ней здесь заботились. Элизабет ухаживала за больной молча.</p>
<p>После завтрака пришли сестры мистера Бингли, и Элизабет почувствовала к ним симпатию, увидев, сколько заботы и внимания оказывают они своей подруге. Приехавший вскоре аптекарь, осмотрев больную, сказал, что, как и предполагалось, заболевание вызвано сильной простудой, потребовал принятия самых энергичных мер, предписал постельный режим и обещал прислать микстуру. Предписание было исполнено сразу, так как лихорадка и головная боль все время усиливались. Элизабет не покидала сестру ни на минуту. Другие дамы также почти не отлучались — правда, делать им было больше нечего, так как мужчин не было дома.</p>
<p>К трем часам Элизабет почувствовала, что ей пора возвращаться, и неохотно об этом сказала. Мисс Бингли предложила ей экипаж, и она почти готова была им воспользоваться. Однако Джейн так огорчилась предстоявшей разлукой, что мисс Бингли поневоле пригласила Элизабет провести еще некоторое время в Незерфилде. Приглашение было с благодарностью принято, и в Лонгборн послали слугу, чтобы предупредить родных и доставить необходимое платье.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id9"></span></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА VIII</p>
</div>
<p>В пять часов дамы ушли переодеваться, и в половине шестого Элизабет позвали к столу. Отвечая на вежливые расспросы о здоровье больной, она с удовольствием отметила про себя искреннее беспокойство мистера Бингли.</p>
<p>К сожалению, нельзя было сообщить ничего утешительного. Состояние Джейн по-прежнему оставалось тяжелым. Услышав это, сестры мистера Бингли три или четыре раза выразили свое огорчение, порассуждали о том, какая ужасная вещь — простуда, и насколько каждая из них не любит болеть, и больше уже о подруге не вспоминали. И Элизабет почувствовала к ним прежнюю неприязнь, убедившись, как мало они думают о Джейн в ее отсутствие.</p>
<p>Из всей компании единственным человеком, заслуживавшим ее симпатию, был мистер Бингли. Элизабет сознавала, что остальные смотрят на нее как на непрошеную гостью, и только Бингли своим искренним беспокойством о больной и вниманием к ее сестре несколько смягчал это ощущение. Кроме мистера Бингли, ее едва ли кто замечал. Внимание мисс Бингли было полностью поглощено мистером Дарси, миссис Хёрст старалась не отставать от сестры, что же касается сидевшего рядом с Элизабет мистера Хёрста — бездушного человека, из тех, что живут на свете лишь для того, чтобы есть, пить и играть в карты, — то после того, как он узнал, что жаркое она предпочитает рагу<a href="#ref30" class="a" onclick="save();">[7]</a>, ему больше не о чем было с ней говорить.</p>
<p>Сразу же после обеда Элизабет вернулась к Джейн. И как только она вышла из комнаты, мисс Бингли принялась злословить на ее счет. Ее манеры были признаны вызывающими и самонадеянными, и было сказано, что она полностью лишена вкуса, красоты, изящества и умения поддерживать разговор. Миссис Хёрст думала то же самое. При этом она добавила:</p>
<p>— Короче говоря, единственным положительным свойством этой девицы является способность преодолевать по утрам необыкновенно большие расстояния пешком. Никогда не забуду, в каком виде она появилась сегодня — словно какая-то дикарка.</p>
<p>— Она и была ею, Луиза. Я едва сдержалась от смеха. Ее приход вообще — такая нелепость. Если сестра ее простудилась, ей-то зачем было бежать в такую даль? А что за вид — лицо обветренное, волосы растрепанные!..</p>
<p>— Да, а ее юбка! Надеюсь, вы видели ее юбку — в грязи дюймов на шесть, ручаюсь. Она старалась опустить пониже края плаща, чтобы прикрыть пятна на подоле, но, увы, это не помогало.</p>
<p>— Быть может, это все верно, — сказал Бингли, — но я, признаюсь, ничего такого не заметил. Мне показалось, что мисс Элизабет Беннет прекрасно выглядит, когда она вошла к нам сегодня утром. А грязи на подоле я просто не разглядел.</p>
<p>— Вы-то, надеюсь, ее разглядели, мистер Дарси? — сказала мисс Бингли. — Я полагаю, вам не хотелось бы встретить в таком виде вашу сестру.</p>
<p>— Вы совершенно правы.</p>
<p>— Пройти пешком три, нет, четыре, да нет — пять или сколько там миль, чуть ли не по колено в грязи, к тому же в совершенном одиночестве! О чем она думала? Я в этом вижу худший вид сумасбродства — свойственное провинциалам пренебрежение всеми приличиями.</p>
<p>— Это могло быть также проявлением весьма похвальной привязанности к родной сестре, — сказал мистер Бингли.</p>
<p>— Боюсь, мистер Дарси, — тихонько сказала мисс Бингли, — как бы сегодняшнее приключение не повредило вашему мнению о ее глазах.</p>
<p>— Отнюдь нет, — ответил он. — После прогулки они горели еще ярче.</p>
<p>Наступила короткая пауза, вслед за которой миссис Хёрст начала снова:</p>
<p>— Мне очень нравится Джейн Беннет. Она в самом деле славная девочка. И я от души желаю ей счастливо устроиться в жизни. Но боюсь, что при таких родителях и прочей родне у нее для этого мало возможностей.</p>
<p>— Ты, кажется, говорила, что их дядя — стряпчий в Меритоне?</p>
<p>— Как же! А еще один живет в Чипсайде<a href="#ref28" class="a" onclick="save();">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>— Просто прелесть! — воскликнула мисс Бингли, и обе чуть не покатились со смеху.</p>
<p>— Даже если бы их дядюшки заселили весь Чипсайд, — решительно заявил Бингли, — она не стала бы от этого менее привлекательной.</p>
<p>— Да, но это весьма помешало бы ей выйти замуж за человека с некоторым положением в обществе, — заметил Дарси.</p>
<p>Бингли ничего не ответил, но его сестры горячо поддержали Дарси и продолжали еще довольно долго острить насчет вульгарных родичей их дорогой подруги.</p>
<p>Спустя некоторое время они все же почувствовали новый прилив нежности и опять отправились к ней в комнату, где оставались до тех пор, пока их не позвали пить кофе. Джейн по-прежнему чувствовала себя плохо, и Элизабет не покидала ее до позднего вечера. Несколько успокоенная тем, что больная заснула, она в конце концов ощутила не желание, а скорее необходимость примкнуть к остальному обществу. Когда она вошла в гостиную, все сидели за картами. Ее тут же пригласили принять участие в игре. Боясь, однако, что игра идет на крупные ставки, Элизабет отказалась, сославшись на болезнь сестры и сказав, что непродолжительное время, в течение которого она может побыть внизу, она охотнее проведет за книгой. Мистер Хёрст посмотрел на нее с удивлением.</p>
<p>— Вы картам предпочитаете чтение? — спросил он. — Странно!</p>
<p>— Мисс Элиза Беннет, — сказала мисс Бингли, — презирает игру. Она много читает и не признает других удовольствий.</p>
<p>— Я не заслуживаю ни похвал, ни упреков такого рода, — ответила Элизабет. — Мне нравятся разные вещи, и я не так уж много читаю.</p>
<p>— Я убежден, например, что вам нравится ухаживать за вашей сестрой, — сказал Бингли. — Надеюсь, это удовольствие еще возрастет по мере ее выздоровления.</p>
<p>Элизабет душевно его поблагодарила и направилась к столу, где лежало несколько книг. При этом Бингли предложил показать ей другие книги, хранящиеся в библиотеке.</p>
<p>— Я был бы рад, если бы, к вашей пользе, а моей чести, мог похвалиться более обширным собранием. Но я ленив, и, хотя оно совсем невелико, в нем больше книг, чем я когда-либо надеюсь прочесть.</p>
<p>Элизабет уверила его, что ей вполне достаточно тех, что находятся в комнате.</p>
<p>— Меня удивляет, — сказала мисс Бингли, — что наш отец обходился таким малым количеством книг. Зато какая превосходная библиотека у вас в Пемберли, мистер Дарси!</p>
<p>— Другой там быть не могло, — ответил Дарси. — Она создана заботами не одного поколения.</p>
<p>— Но как много вы к ней прибавили сами! Вы все время покупаете книги.</p>
<p>— Было бы странно, если бы я пренебрегал фамильной библиотекой в такое время, как наше.</p>
<p>— Пренебрегали! Конечно, вы не пренебрегаете ничем, что могло бы еще больше украсить этот славный уголок. Чарлз, если у тебя будет собственный дом, хотела бы я, чтобы он хотя бы вполовину был так хорош, как Пемберли.</p>
<p>— Я бы сам этого желал.</p>
<p>— Правда, я бы тебе советовала купить имение где-нибудь неподалеку от Пемберли, приняв его за образец. Во всей Англии я не знаю лучшего графства, чем Дербишир.</p>
<p>— От души с тобой согласен. Я даже купил бы Пемберли, если бы Дарси его продал.</p>
<p>— Я говорю о возможном, Чарлз.</p>
<p>— Честное слово, Кэролайн, владельцем такого имения можно скорее сделаться, купив Пемберли, нежели пытаясь его воспроизвести.</p>
<p>Этот разговор настолько заинтересовал Элизабет, что она перестала читать и вскоре, отложив книгу, подошла к карточному столу; поместившись между мистером Бингли и миссис Хёрст, она начала наблюдать за игрой.</p>
<p>— Мисс Дарси, я думаю, заметно выросла с прошлой весны, — сказала мисс Бингли. — Она, наверно, станет такой же высокой, как я.</p>
<p>— Вполне возможно. Сейчас она ростом, пожалуй, с мисс Элизабет Беннет или даже чуть-чуть повыше.</p>
<p>— Как бы мне хотелось снова ее увидеть! Я не встречала никого в жизни, кто бы мне так понравился. Ее внешность и манеры очаровательны. А какая образованность в подобном возрасте! Она играет на фортепьяно не хуже подлинных музыкантов.</p>
<p>— Меня удивляет, — сказал Бингли, — как это у всех молодых леди хватает терпения, чтобы стать образованными.</p>
<p>— Все молодые леди образованные?! Чарлз, дорогой, что ты хочешь этим сказать?</p>
<p>— По-моему, все. Все они рисуют пейзажи, раскрашивают экраны и вяжут кошельки. Я не знаю, наверно, ни одной девицы, которая не умела бы этого делать. И мне, пожалуй, не приходилось слышать, чтобы о молодой леди не сказали, насколько она прекрасно образованна.</p>
<p>— Ваше перечисление совершенств молодых женщин, — сказал Дарси, — к сожалению, верно. Образованной называют всякую барышню, которая заслуживает этого тем, что вяжет кошельки или раскрашивает экраны. Но я далек от того, чтобы согласиться с вашим мнением о женском образовании. Я, например, не мог бы похвастаться, что среди знакомых мне женщин наберется больше пяти-шести образованных по-настоящему.</p>
<p>— Я с вами вполне согласна, — сказала мисс Бингли.</p>
<p>— В таком случае, — заметила Элизабет, — вы, вероятно, можете дать точное определение понятия «образованная женщина»?</p>
<p>— Да, оно кажется мне достаточно ясным.</p>
<p>— О, в самом деле! — воскликнула его преданная союзница. — По-настоящему образованным может считаться лишь тот, кто стоит на голову выше всех окружающих. Женщина, заслуживающая это название, должна быть хорошо обучена музыке, пению, живописи, танцам и иностранным языкам. И кроме всего, она должна обладать каким-то особым своеобразием внешности, манер, походки, интонации и языка — иначе это название все-таки будет заслуженным только наполовину.</p>
<p>— Всем этим она действительно должна обладать, — сказал Дарси. — Но я бы добавил к этому нечто более существенное — развитый обширным чтением ум.</p>
<p>— В таком случае меня нисколько не удивляет, что вы знаете только пять-шесть образованных женщин. Скорее мне кажется странным, что вам все же удалось их сыскать.</p>
<p>— Неужели вы так требовательны к собственному полу и сомневаетесь, что подобные женщины существуют?</p>
<p>— Мне они не встречались. Я никогда не видела, чтобы в одном человеке сочетались все те способности, манеры и вкус, которые были вами сейчас перечислены.</p>
<p>Миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли возмутились несправедливостью такого упрека их полу и стали наперебой уверять, что им приходилось встречать немало женщин, вполне отвечающих предложенному описанию, пока наконец мистер Хёрст не призвал их к порядку, жалуясь на их невнимание к игре. Разговор прекратился, и Элизабет вскоре вышла из комнаты.</p>
<p>— Элиза Беннет, — сказала мисс Бингли, когда дверь затворилась, — принадлежит к тем девицам, которые пытаются понравиться представителям другого пола, унижая свой собственный. На многих мужчин, признаюсь, это действует. Но, по-моему, это низкая уловка худшего толка.</p>
<p>— Несомненно, — отозвался Дарси, к которому это замечание было обращено. — Низким является любой способ, употребляемый женщинами для привлечения мужчин. Все, что порождается хитростью, отвратительно.</p>
<p>Мисс Бингли не настолько была удовлетворена полученным ответом, чтобы продолжить разговор на ту же тему.</p>
<p>Элизабет снова вернулась к ним, сообщив, что ее сестре стало хуже и что она не сможет больше от нее отлучаться. Бингли принялся настаивать, чтобы немедленно послали за мистером Джонсом. Его сестры стали уверять, что в глуши нельзя получить должной помощи, и советовали послать экипаж за известным врачом из столицы. Элизабет и слышать не хотела об этом, но охотно согласилась с предложением мистера Бингли. Было решено, что за мистером Джонсом пошлют рано утром, если к тому времени Джейн не станет значительно лучше. Бингли был очень обеспокоен, а его сестры заявили, что чувствуют себя крайне несчастными. Однако им удалось утешить себя пением дуэтов после ужина, в то время как он нашел единственное успокоение в том, что обязал дворецкого оказывать больной гостье и ее сестре самое большое внимание.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА IX</p>
</div>
<p>Почти всю ночь Элизабет провела у постели больной и, к своему удовлетворению, утром могла сообщить довольно благоприятные сведения о ее здоровье через горничную, очень рано присланную мистером Бингли, а затем через двух элегантных особ, которые прислуживали его сестрам. Однако, несмотря на наметившийся перелом, она все же попросила помочь ей передать в Лонгборн записку, в которой настаивала на приезде матери, чтобы та сама оценила положение. Записка была послана незамедлительно и так же быстро исполнена содержавшаяся в ней просьба. Миссис Беннет в сопровождении двух дочек прибыла в Незерфилд вскоре после того, как семья позавтракала.</p>
<p>Если бы мать нашла Джейн в опасном состоянии, она, несомненно, была бы этим удручена. Но, успокоенная тем, что болезнь Джейн не была угрожающей, она не желала, чтобы дочь выздоровела слишком быстро, так как это заставило бы ее вскоре покинуть Незерфилд. Поэтому она даже слушать не захотела, когда Джейн попросила, чтобы ее перевезли домой. Приехавший следом аптекарь тоже не счел переезд разумным. После того как миссис Беннет немного побыла с Джейн, к ним поднялась мисс Бингли и пригласила ее и трех ее дочек в комнату для завтрака. Мистер Бингли, встретив их там, выразил надежду, что состояние Джейн не оказалось более тяжким, чем ожидала миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>— Увы, сэр, именно так! — отвечала она. — Бедняжка слишком плоха, чтобы ее можно было перевезти в Лонгборн. По мнению мистера Джонса, об этом нельзя и думать. Придется нам еще некоторое время пользоваться вашим гостеприимством.</p>
<p>— Перевезти в Лонгборн! — воскликнул Бингли. — Об этом не может быть и речи. Моя сестра, я уверен, не захочет и слышать о переезде.</p>
<p>— Можете не сомневаться, сударыня, — с холодной учтивостью заметила мисс Бингли. — Если мисс Беннет останется в нашем доме, ей будет уделено необходимое внимание.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет весьма пылко выразила свою признательность.</p>
<p>— О, я уверена, — добавила она, — не будь вокруг нее близких друзей, с нею бы уже случилось бог знает что. Бедняжка в самом деле плоха, — она так страдает, несмотря на присущее ей терпение. Но ведь это свойство ее ангельского характера, с каким вы едва ли где-нибудь встретитесь. Я часто говорю моим девочкам, что им до Джейн далеко. Мне очень нравится эта комната, мистер Бингли! Какой очаровательный вид на главную парковую дорожку. Не знаю, есть ли в нашем графстве уголок, подобный Незерфилду. Вам не захочется скоро его покинуть, не так ли, хоть вы и арендовали его ненадолго?</p>
<p>— Я всегда отличался стремительностью, — ответил он. — Если я решусь покинуть Незерфилд, меня, возможно, не будет здесь уже через пять минут. В данное время, однако, мне кажется, что я устроился основательно.</p>
<p>— Именно этого я от вас и ожидала, — сказала Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Вы начинаете разбираться в моем характере, не правда ли? — ответил, обернувшись к ней, Бингли.</p>
<p>— О да, я вас вполне понимаю.</p>
<p>— Хотелось бы мне считать это комплиментом. Но человек, которого видно насквозь, кажется, наверно, немного жалким.</p>
<p>— Это зависит от обстоятельств. Характеры скрытные и сложные не обязательно оцениваются выше или ниже, чем натуры, подобные вашей.</p>
<p>— Лиззи, — вмешалась мать, — пожалуйста, не забывай, где ты находишься, и не болтай всякие глупости, которые ты себе позволяешь дома.</p>
<p>— Я и не подозревал, — сказал Бингли, — что вы занимаетесь изучением человеческой природы. Должно быть, это интересный предмет?</p>
<p>— Особенно интересны сложные характеры. Этого преимущества у них не отнять.</p>
<p>— Провинция, — сказал Дарси, — дает немного материала для такого изучения. Слишком ограничен и неизменен круг людей, с которыми здесь можно соприкоснуться.</p>
<p>— Люди, однако, меняются сами так сильно, что то и дело в каждом человеке можно подметить что-нибудь новое.</p>
<p>— О, в самом деле, — воскликнула миссис Беннет, задетая тоном Дарси, которым он говорил о провинциальном обществе, — смею вас уверить, что в провинции всего этого ничуть не меньше, чем в городе!</p>
<p>Все были изумлены, и Дарси, бросив на нее взгляд, молча отвернулся. Однако гостье, вообразившей, что ею одержана решительная победа, захотелось развить успех.</p>
<p>— Я, со своей стороны, вовсе не считаю, что у Лондона есть какие-нибудь серьезные преимущества перед провинцией, — конечно, если не иметь в виду магазинов и развлечений. В провинции жить приятнее, не правда ли, мистер Бингли?</p>
<p>— Когда я нахожусь в провинции, — ответил он, — мне не хочется из нее уезжать. Но когда я попадаю в столицу, со мной происходит то же самое. У того и у другого — свои хорошие стороны. Я мог бы быть одинаково счастлив и тут и там.</p>
<p>— Да, но это потому, что вы обо всем здраво судите. А вот этот джентльмен, — она взглянула на Дарси, — смотрит на провинциальную жизнь свысока.</p>
<p>— Вы ошибаетесь, сударыня, — вмешалась Элизабет, краснея за свою мать. — Вы неправильно поняли мистера Дарси. Он хотел лишь сказать, что в провинции встречаешься с меньшим разнообразием людей, чем в городе, — а с этим вы, разумеется, согласитесь.</p>
<p>— Конечно, дорогая моя, никто и не говорит о большем разнообразии. Впрочем, что касается круга знакомств, то мне не верится, что он здесь меньше, чем где-нибудь в другом месте. Нас приглашают обедать в двадцать четыре дома.</p>
<p>Едва ли мистеру Бингли удалось бы сохранить при этом серьезное выражение лица, если бы он не счел необходимым пощадить чувства Элизабет. Его сестра была не столь деликатна и посмотрела на Дарси с весьма выразительной улыбкой. Пытаясь придумать что-нибудь, что могло бы направить мысли матери по новому руслу, Элизабет спросила у миссис Беннет, не заходила ли в ее отсутствие Шарлотта Лукас.</p>
<p>— О да, вчера она была у нас со своим отцом. Что за милейший человек этот сэр Уильям — не правда ли, мистер Бингли? Настоящая светскость: благородство и любезность! У него всегда найдется, что сказать каждому человеку. Вот, по-моему, образец хорошего тона! Особы, которые воображают о себе бог знает что и даже не желают раскрыть рта, напрасно предполагают, что они хорошо воспитаны.</p>
<p>— Шарлотта с вами обедала?</p>
<p>— Нет, она спешила домой. Наверно, ей нужно было помочь готовить пирог. Что касается нас, мистер Бингли, то я у себя держу таких слуг, которые сами справляются со своей работой. О да, мои девочки воспитаны по-другому. Каждый, впрочем, поступает как может. Девицы Лукас все же очень милы, могу вас уверить. Так обидно, что они некрасивы. Я не говорю, что Шарлотта совсем безобразна — она наш большой друг.</p>
<p>— Кажется, она очень приятная молодая женщина, — сказал Бингли.</p>
<p>— О, еще бы! Но не станете же вы отрицать, что она дурнушка. Это признает сама леди Лукас, завидуя красоте моей Джейн. Не хотелось бы хвалиться собственной дочерью, но, если уж говорить о Джейн, не часто найдешь такую красавицу. Об этом слышишь на каждом шагу — себе самой я бы не поверила. Когда ей только минуло пятнадцать, мы жили у моего брата Гардинера в Лондоне. И, представьте, там был один джентльмен, который влюбился в нее без памяти. Невестка ждала уже, что он вот-вот сделает ей предложение — еще до того, как мы уедем. Правда, этого не случилось. Быть может, он считал, что Джейн чересчур молода. Зато он посвятил ей стихи — знаете, просто очаровательные.</p>
<p>— Тем этот роман и кончился, — поспешно вмешалась Элизабет. — Я думаю, это не единственное увлечение, нашедшее подобный конец. Интересно, кто первый открыл, что поэзия убивает любовь?</p>
<p>— Я привык считать поэзию питательной средой для любви, — сказал Дарси.</p>
<p>— Да — прочной, здоровой и страстной любви — возможно. То, что уже окрепло, может питаться чем угодно. Но если говорить о легкой склонности, — я уверена, что после одного хорошего сонета от нее может не остаться и следа.</p>
<p>Дарси улыбнулся. В наступившем молчании Элизабет с тревогой ждала, что мать произнесет какую-нибудь новую бестактность. Миссис Беннет в самом деле очень хотелось поговорить, но ей ничего не пришло в голову. И после некоторой паузы она стала снова благодарить мистера Бингли за его заботу о Джейн и извиняться за беспокойство, которое ему причиняет еще и Лиззи. Бингли был искренне любезен в своих ответах, заставив быть вежливой и свою младшую сестру, которая произнесла все, что подобало при таких обстоятельствах. И хотя свою роль она исполнила без особого рвения, миссис Беннет все же осталась вполне довольна и вскоре попросила подать экипаж. В то же мгновение, как по сигналу, выступила ее младшая дочка. Китти и Лидия в течение всего визита перешептывались между собой. При этом они договорились, что младшая должна напомнить мистеру Бингли про обещание устроить бал в Незерфилде, которое он дал по приезде в Хартфордшир.</p>
<p>Лидия, рослая, недурная собой пятнадцатилетняя девица, была любимицей матери. Именно благодаря этой привязанности она начала выезжать в свет в столь юном возрасте. Ее природные предприимчивость и общительность развились в самонадеянность благодаря вниманию офицеров, которых привлекали хорошие обеды дядюшки и ее врожденное легкомыслие. Поэтому ей ничего не стоило заговорить с мистером Бингли о бале и прямо напомнить ему про его обязательство, добавив, что с его стороны было бы позорнейшим упущением, если бы он не сдержал слова. Его ответ на этот неожиданный выпад был весьма приятен для слуха миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>— Поверьте, я с радостью выполню свое обещание. И как только мисс Беннет поправится, я попрошу, чтобы именно вы соблаговолили выбрать день для этого праздника. Но пока она больна, вам, я полагаю, и самой не захотелось бы танцевать.</p>
<p>Лидия сказала, что вполне удовлетворена его словами. — О да, гораздо лучше подождать, пока Джейн выздоровеет. К тому же за это время в Меритон может вернуться капитан Картер. А после вашего бала, — добавила она, — я заставлю их устроить свой. Так и скажу полковнику Форстеру, что ему стыдно уклоняться.</p>
<p>После этого миссис Беннет и ее младшие дочки уехали, а Элизабет сразу вернулась к Джейн, предоставив двум леди и мистеру Дарси возможность беспрепятственно злословить о ней и ее родных. Впрочем, несмотря на все остроты мисс Бингли по поводу ее «очаровательных глазок», дамы так и не смогли заставить мистера Дарси что-нибудь в ней осудить.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id11"></span></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА Х</p>
</div>
<p>В остальном день прошел почти так же, как предыдущий. Миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли провели в первой половине дня несколько часов у больной, которая продолжала мало-помалу поправляться. Вечером Элизабет спустилась в гостиную, где собралось остальное общество. На этот раз карточного стола не было. Мистер Дарси писал письмо, а сидевшая рядом с ним мисс Бингли следила за его пером и постоянно отвлекала его внимание различными пожеланиями, которые она просила передать его сестре. Мистер Хёрст и мистер Бингли играли в пикет, а миссис наблюдала за их игрой.</p>
<p>Элизабет, принявшись за шитье, испытала немалое удовольствие, прислушиваясь к тому, что происходило между Дарси и его соседкой. Непрерывные восторженные замечания леди по поводу его почерка, ровности строчек или пространности письма и полные равнодушия к похвалам ответы джентльмена составили любопытный диалог и в точности соответствовали представлению, сложившемуся у Элизабет, о характерах его участников.</p>
<p>— Этому письму так обрадуется мисс Дарси!</p>
<p>Молчание.</p>
<p>— Вы пишете необыкновенно бегло.</p>
<p>— Вы ошибаетесь. Я пишу довольно медленно.</p>
<p>— Сколько писем приходится вам написать на протяжении года! Да еще деловые письма! Представляю себе, какое это изнурительное занятие.</p>
<p>— Что ж, ваше счастье, что оно досталось на мою долю.</p>
<p>— Напишите ради бога вашей сестре, как мне хочется ее повидать.</p>
<p>— Я уже написал это по вашей просьбе.</p>
<p>— По-моему, у вас плохое перо. Дайте, я его очиню. Я научилась отлично чинить перья.</p>
<p>— Благодарю вас, но я всегда чиню перья собственноручно.</p>
<p>— Как это вы ухитряетесь так ровно писать?</p>
<p>Он промолчал.</p>
<p>— Сообщите вашей сестре, что меня очень обрадовали ее успехи в игре на арфе. И, пожалуйста, передайте, что я в восторге от ее прелестного узора для скатерти и считаю его гораздо более удачным, чем рисунок мисс Грантли.</p>
<p>— Вы позволите отложить ваши восторги до следующего письма? Здесь у меня уже не осталось для них подобающего места.</p>
<p>— О, пусть вас это не беспокоит. Я увижусь с ней в январе. Скажите, вы ей всегда пишете такие восхитительные длинные письма, мистер Дарси?</p>
<p>— Да, они довольно пространные, но насколько они восхитительны, не мне судить.</p>
<p>— Мне кажется само собой разумеющимся, что человек, который способен с легкостью написать длинное письмо, не может написать его плохо.</p>
<p>— Для Дарси это не комплимент, Кэролайн, — вмешался ее брат, — письма даются ему не так-то легко. Слишком уж он старается все время выискивать четырехсложные словечки, — не правда ли, Дарси?<a href="#ref26" class="a" onclick="save();">[9]</a></p>
<p>— Стиль моих писем, разумеется, отличается от вашего.</p>
<p>— О, — воскликнула мисс Бингли, — так небрежно, как пишет Чарлз, не пишет никто. Одну половину слов он пропускает, а вторую — зачеркивает.</p>
<p>— В моей голове мысли проносятся так стремительно, что я не успеваю их выразить. Оттого-то мои письма иной раз не доносят никаких мыслей до тех, кому они адресованы.</p>
<p>— Ваша скромность, мистер Бингли, — сказала Элизабет, — разоружила бы любого вашего критика.</p>
<p>— Нет ничего более обманчивого, — сказал Дарси, — чем показная скромность. Под ней часто скрывается равнодушие к посторонним мнениям, а иногда и замаскированная похвальба<a href="#ref35" class="a" onclick="save();">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>— Чем же вы назовете мое смиренное суждение?</p>
<p>— Разумеется, замаскированной похвальбой. Ведь в глубине души вы гордитесь недостатками своих писем. Вы считаете, что их порождает быстрота мысли и небрежность исполнения — свойства хоть и не похвальные, но все же не лишенные привлекательности. Способность делать что-либо быстро всегда высоко ценится ее обладателем, зачастую независимо от качества исполнения. Сегодня утром вы ведь хотели представить себя в самом выгодном свете, заявив миссис Беннет, что не задержались бы в Незерфилде и пяти минут, если бы вам вздумалось его покинуть. По существу же, что похвального в поспешности, из-за которой важные дела могут остаться незаконченными и от которой никакого проку нет ни вам самому, ни кому-либо другому?</p>
<p>— Ну, это уж чересчур, — воскликнул Бингли, — упрекать вечером за вздор, сказанный поутру. Впрочем, клянусь честью, я верил в то, что говорил о себе тогда, и продолжаю в это верить сейчас. И уж, во всяком случае, я говорил о своей излишней торопливости не с тем, чтобы порисоваться перед дамами.</p>
<p>— Не сомневаюсь, вы в это верили. Но я-то вовсе не убежден, что вы бы уехали с такой стремительностью. Ваше поведение точно так же зависело бы от обстоятельств, как и поведение любого другого человека. И если бы в тот момент, когда вы вскакивали бы на коня, поблизости нашелся друг, который сказал бы: «Бингли, а не лучше ли вам на недельку задержаться?» — быть может, вы так бы и поступили и никуда не поехали — другими словами, застряли бы еще на целый месяц.</p>
<p>— Вы только доказали, — воскликнула Элизабет, — что мистер Бингли несправедлив сам к себе. И превознесли его больше, чем это сделал он сам.</p>
<p>— Мне приятно, что вы обращаете слова моего друга в похвалу мягкости моего характера, — сказал Бингли. — Но боюсь, ваше толкование его слов прямо противоположно мысли, которую вкладывал в них Дарси. Он-то, разумеется, думает, что при таких обстоятельствах для меня лучше всего было бы наотрез отказаться и ускакать как можно быстрее.</p>
<p>— Разве мистер Дарси находит, что опрометчивость вашего первоначального решения искупалась бы упрямством, с которым вы его выполнили?</p>
<p>— Честное слово, мне трудно вам объяснить, в чем тут дело. Пусть лучше Дарси говорит за себя.</p>
<p>— Вы хотите, чтобы я защищал мнение, которое мне приписываете, но которого я не высказывал. Допустим, однако, дело обстоит так, как вы говорите. Вы помните, мисс Беннет, мы предположили, что друг, который захотел отсрочить отъезд, выразил только желание, просьбу и даже ничем этой просьбы не объяснил.</p>
<p>— А разве вы не видите заслуги в готовности легко уступить настояниям друга?</p>
<p>— Неразумная уступка не сделала бы чести умственным способностям обоих.</p>
<p>— Мне кажется, мистер Дарси, вы недооцениваете влияние дружбы или привязанности. А между тем уважение к просителю нередко может заставить человека выполнить просьбу, даже не вникая в то, насколько она обоснована. Я не имею в виду случай, который вы предположили в отношении мистера Бингли. Мы можем подождать, пока подобные обстоятельства возникнут в действительности, и уже тогда будем судить о разумности его действий. Но, говоря вообще, если бы кто-то попросил друга отказаться от не слишком важного шага и тот ему уступил, не дожидаясь логических доказательств, неужели бы вы за это его осудили?</p>
<p>— А не следует ли нам, прежде чем обсуждать вопрос дальше, точнее определить значительность просьбы, так же как и степень близости между друзьями?</p>
<p>— Совершенно необходимо! — воскликнул Бингли. — Давайте условимся обо всех мелочах, не забывая даже о росте и силе друзей, — это, мисс Беннет, может иметь гораздо большее значение, чем кажется на первый взгляд. Поверьте, если бы Дарси не выглядел по сравнению со мной таким верзилой, я бы с ним меньше считался. При известных обстоятельствах и в определенных местах он, признаюсь, заставляет себя бояться, особенно в собственном доме и когда ему нечего делать в воскресный вечер.</p>
<p>Дарси улыбнулся, но Элизабет почувствовала, что в глубине души он уязвлен, и сдержала улыбку. Мисс Бингли была возмущена нанесенным ему оскорблением и разбранила брата за его глупую болтовню.</p>
<p>— Я разгадал ваш замысел, Бингли, — сказал его друг. — Вам не нравится наш спор, и вы решили таким способом с ним покончить.</p>
<p>— Быть может. Споры слишком похожи на диспуты. Если вы и мисс Беннет отложите ваши пререкания до тех пор, пока я уйду из комнаты, я буду вам премного обязан. И тогда вы сможете говорить обо мне все, что вам вздумается.</p>
<p>— Ваша просьба, — сказала Элизабет, — не требует жертвы с моей стороны. А для мистера Дарси было бы гораздо лучше, если бы ему удалось закончить письмо.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси воспользовался ее советом и дописал письмо до конца.</p>
<p>Освободившись, он попросил мисс Бингли и Элизабет немного развлечь компанию музыкой. Мисс Бингли устремилась к фортепьяно и, любезно предложив Элизабет выступить первой — от чего та столь же любезно, но более искренне отказалась, — уселась за инструмент.</p>
<p>Миссис Хёрст пела с сестрой. И пока обе они были заняты, Элизабет, перебирая разбросанные на инструменте ноты, невольно заметила, как часто останавливается на ней взор мистера Дарси. Она никак не могла предположить, что этот самодовольный человек ею любуется. Вместе с тем мысль, что он смотрит на нее, испытывая к ней неприязнь, казалась столь же несообразной. В конце концов ей осталось объяснить его внимание тем, что среди присутствовавших в доме людей в ней он чаще всего подмечал несоответствие своим вкусам и взглядам. Эта догадка ничуть ее не огорчила. Он был ей настолько неприятен, что с его мнением о себе она не собиралась считаться.</p>
<p>Исполнив несколько итальянских арий, мисс Бингли для разнообразия начала играть веселую шотландскую мелодию. Почти тотчас же мистер Дарси подошел к Элизабет и сказал:</p>
<p>— А не желаете ли вы, мисс Беннет, воспользоваться случаем и протанцевать рил<a href="#ref33" class="a" onclick="save();">[11]</a>?</p>
<p>Она улыбнулась, ничего не ответив. Удивленный ее молчанием, он повторил свой вопрос.</p>
<p>— Я вас прекрасно расслышала, — сказала она. — Просто я не сразу нашла ответ. Вам, конечно, хотелось, чтобы, приняв приглашение, я дала вам желанный повод убедиться в моих низменных вкусах. Но я всегда любила разгадывать такого рода ловушки, лишая их авторов предвкушаемого удовольствия. Вот почему мне пришло в голову сказать, что я вообще терпеть не могу танцевать рил. А теперь осуждайте меня, если можете!</p>
<p>— Поверьте, я при всех случаях не мог бы вас осудить!</p>
<p>Элизабет, считавшая, что ее слова должны были его задеть, была удивлена его любезностью. Но прелестное лукавство, сквозившее в ее поведении, едва ли могло задеть кого бы то ни было. Дарси чувствовал, что он еще никогда не был так сильно очарован никакой другой женщиной. И ему было ясно, что, если бы у Элизабет оказались более подходящие родичи, его сердцу угрожала бы некоторая опасность.</p>
<p>Мисс Бингли заметила или заподозрила достаточно, чтобы почувствовать ревность. Поэтому ее горячая забота о скорейшем выздоровлении ее дорогой подруги Джейн соединилась в ней с желанием поскорее отделаться от ее сестры.</p>
<p>Она часто пыталась настроить Дарси против Элизабет болтовней об их предполагаемом браке и рассуждениями о том, насколько он будет счастлив с такой женой.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, — сказала мисс Бингли, когда они на следующее утро прогуливались вдвоем по обсаженным кустами дорожкам около дома, — после того как столь желанное событие совершится, вам удастся намекнуть вашей теще, как полезно иногда держать язык за зубами. А когда с этим вы справитесь — отучите младших сестер от привычки бегать за офицерами. И если только мне позволено затронуть столь деликатную тему, постарайтесь избавить вашу избранницу от чего-то такого, что граничит с высокомерием и наглостью.</p>
<p>— Может быть, вы посоветуете мне еще что-нибудь полезное для моего семейного счастья?</p>
<p>— О, разумеется! Непременно повесьте портрет дядюшки Филипса в галерее Пемберли. Где-нибудь рядом с портретом судьи — дяди вашего отца. Они ведь представители одной и той же профессии<a href="#ref31" class="a" onclick="save();">[12]</a>, не правда ли, хотя и разных ее сторон? Что же касается портрета вашей Элизабет, то даже не пытайтесь его заказывать. Разве какой-нибудь художник сумеет достойно запечатлеть на полотне эти прекрасные глазки?</p>
<p>— Их выражение в самом деле будет не так-то легко передать. Но их форму, цвет, необыкновенно длинные ресницы хороший художник сможет изобразить.</p>
<p>В эту минуту они встретились с самой Элизабет и миссис Хёрст, которые шли по другой дорожке.</p>
<p>— Я не знала, что вы собираетесь на прогулку! — воскликнула мисс Бингли, несколько обеспокоенная тем, что слова их могли быть услышаны.</p>
<p>— Как вам не стыдно! Убежали из дому втихомолку, — ответила миссис Хёрст.</p>
<p>И, уцепившись за свободную руку мистера Дарси, она предоставила Элизабет дальше идти одной, — ширины дорожки как раз хватало для трех человек. Мистер Дарси, заметив ее бестактность, тотчас же сказал:</p>
<p>— Эта тропинка недостаточно широка для нашей компании. Давайте выйдем на аллею.</p>
<p>Однако Элизабет, которой очень хотелось от них отделаться, весело ответила:</p>
<p>— Нет, нет, пожалуйста, останьтесь! Вы образуете необыкновенно живописную группу. Гармония будет нарушена, если к вам присоединится четвертый. Прощайте!</p>
<p>И она с радостью убежала от них, довольная тем, что через день или два сможет наконец вернуться домой. Джейн чувствовала себя настолько лучше, что уже в этот вечер собиралась ненадолго покинуть свою комнату.</p>
<p></span><span id="id12"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XI</p>
</div>
<p>Когда дамы после обеда вышли из-за стола, Элизабет поднялась к Джейн и, хорошенько ее закутав, спустилась с ней в гостиную, где больная была встречена радостными возгласами своих подруг. За все время знакомства Элизабет с сестрами мистера Бингли они еще никогда не казались ей такими приветливыми, как в течение того часа, пока дамы ждали прихода мужчин. Обе они великолепно умели поддержать разговор, могли подробно описать какое-нибудь развлечение, с юмором рассказать анекдот, с задором высмеять кого-нибудь из знакомых.</p>
<p>Однако, когда мужчины появились, Джейн сразу же отошла на второй план, взгляд мисс Бингли остановился на Дарси, и не успел он сделать нескольких шагов, как ей уже нужно было что-то ему сказать. Подойдя к Джейн, Дарси любезно поздравил ее с выздоровлением. Мистер Хёрст также ей слегка поклонился, пробормотав нечто вроде: «Я весьма рад». Зато приветствие Бингли было пылким и многоречивым. Он был полон забот и восторга. Первые полчаса он потратил на разведение огня в камине, чтобы Джейн не было холодно. По его настоянию она перешла в кресло около камина, чтобы находиться подальше от дверей. Затем он расположился подле нее и в течение всего вечера разговаривал почти только с ней. Элизабет, сидевшая за шитьем в противоположном углу, следила за всеми его хлопотами с большим удовлетворением.</p>
<p>После чая мистер Хёрст тщетно пытался напомнить невестке о карточном столике. Кэролайн знала доподлинно, что у мистера Дарси нет желания сесть за игру. Громкое обращение мистера Хёрста ко всем собравшимся было отклонено. Мисс Бингли ответила ему, что играть никому не хочется. И так как это подтверждалось общим молчанием, мистеру Хёрсту не осталось ничего иного, как растянуться на диване и сразу заснуть. Дарси взял книгу, мисс Бингли сделала то же самое, а миссис Хёрст занялась тем, что стала перебирать свои браслеты и кольца, изредка вставляя словечко в разговор брата и Джейн.</p>
<p>Внимание мисс Бингли в равной степени было поглощено чтением собственной книги и наблюдением за тем, как читал свою книгу мистер Дарси. Она то и дело о чем-нибудь его спрашивала и заглядывала в раскрытую перед ним страницу. Однако вовлечь его в беседу ей не удавалось: он кратко отвечал на вопросы и продолжал читать. Наконец, совершенно обессиленная тщетными попытками сосредоточиться на собственной книге, выбранной только потому, что она стояла на полке рядом с томом, который читал Дарси, мисс Бингли, широко зевнув, сказала:</p>
<p>— Как приятно так провести вечер! Говоря откровенно, я не знаю удовольствий, подобных чтению. Насколько быстрее устаешь от всякого другого занятия! Когда я обзаведусь собственным домом, я почувствую себя несчастной, если у меня не будет хорошей библиотеки.</p>
<p>Никто не ответил. Она зевнула еще раз, отшвырнула книгу и оглядела комнату в поисках какого-нибудь развлечения. Услышав, что брат говорит с мисс Беннет о бале, она внезапно повернулась к нему и сказала:</p>
<p>— Между прочим, Чарлз, ты в самом деле намерен устраивать танцы в Незерфилде? Прежде чем принять такое решение, я бы тебе советовала узнать, как к этому относятся присутствующие в этой комнате. Думаю, что не ошибусь, если скажу, что среди нас может найтись кто-то, кому бал едва ли будет по вкусу.</p>
<p>— Ты, видимо, имеешь в виду Дарси, — ответил мистер Бингли. — Что ж, если ему будет угодно, он может отправиться спать. А что касается самого бала, это вопрос решенный. И как только все будет готово и Николс наготовит достаточно белого супа<a href="#ref29" class="a" onclick="save();">[13]</a>, я немедленно разошлю приглашения.</p>
<p>— Я бы любила балы гораздо больше, — сказала мисс Бингли, — если бы они устраивались по-другому. Нынешние балы невыносимо скучны. Насколько было бы разумнее, если бы во время бала танцы были заменены серьезной беседой.</p>
<p>— Конечно, разумнее, дорогая. Но, осмелюсь сказать, это вряд ли было бы похоже на бал.</p>
<p>Мисс Бингли, не снизойдя до ответа, вскоре поднялась и стала прохаживаться по комнате. У нее была стройная фигура и красивая походка. Однако Дарси, для которого предназначался показ этих качеств, был по-прежнему поглощен чтением. В отчаянии она предприняла еще один маневр и, повернувшись к Элизабет, сказала:</p>
<p>— Мисс Элиза Беннет, позвольте вам предложить последовать моему примеру и немножко пройтись. Уверяю вас, после того как долго сидишь на одном месте, это действует ободряюще.</p>
<p>Элизабет удивилась, но уступила ее просьбе. Мисс Бингли добилась успеха и в отношении истинного предмета своих маневров. Дарси поднял глаза. Проявление внимания мисс Бингли по этому адресу было для него не меньшей новостью, чем для самой Элизабет, и он бессознательно захлопнул книгу. Ему тотчас же предложили присоединиться к их компании, но он отказался. По его словам, эта прогулка по комнате могла быть вызвана только двумя причинами, причем в обоих случаях его участие сделалось бы для них помехой.</p>
<p>«Что он хотел этим сказать? Она умирает от желания узнать, что он имел в виду!» — И мисс Бингли обратилась к Элизабет с вопросом, догадывается ли она, что бы это могло означать.</p>
<p>— Конечно, нет, — ответила та. — Но можете быть уверены, — чем-то он хотел нас задеть. И самый верный способ вызвать разочарование мистера Дарси — это ни о чем его не расспрашивать.</p>
<p>Мисс Бингли, однако, не могла чем бы то ни было разочаровать мистера Дарси. Поэтому она продолжала настаивать, чтобы ей объяснили скрытый смысл его слов.</p>
<p>— Ничего не имею против, — сказал мистер Дарси, как только ему позволили говорить. — Вы выбрали этот вид препровождения времени, так как либо весьма доверяете друг другу и должны поделиться каким-то секретом, либо думаете, что выглядите особенно красиво, когда прогуливаетесь. В первом случае я буду для вас помехой, во втором же — я с большим успехом могу любоваться вами, сидя здесь у камина.</p>
<p>— Какой ужас! — воскликнула мисс Бингли. — Я никогда в жизни не слышала ничего более дерзкого. Как наказать нам его за эти слова?</p>
<p>— Нет ничего проще, стоит лишь захотеть по-настоящему, — сказала Элизабет. — Мы все можем легко друг друга задеть. Дразните его, смейтесь над ним. Вы же с ним близкие друзья — должны же вы знать его слабые стороны.</p>
<p>— Честное слово, не знаю. Уверяю вас, наше знакомство меня этому не научило. Дразнить само хладнокровие и присутствие духа! Нет, нет, я чувствую, из этого ничего не выйдет. Не захотим же мы выглядеть дурочками, смеясь без всякого повода. О нет, мистер Дарси может быть спокоен.</p>
<p>— Разве над мистером Дарси нельзя смеяться? — удивилась Элизабет. — Какое редкое преимущество! Настолько редкое, что я надеюсь, оно останется исключением. Мне бы пришлось плохо, если бы у меня оказалось много таких знакомых, — я очень люблю смешное.</p>
<p>— Мисс Бингли, — отвечал Дарси, — приписывает мне неуязвимость, которой я, увы, вовсе не обладаю. Мудрейшие и благороднейшие из людей, нет, мудрейшие и благороднейшие их поступки могут быть высмеяны теми, для кого главное в жизни — насмешка.</p>
<p>— Конечно, такие люди бывают, — сказала Элизабет. — Надеюсь, я не принадлежу к их числу. Мне кажется, я никогда не высмеивала мудрость и благородство. Глупость и причуды, капризы и непоследовательность кажутся мне смешными, и, когда мне это удается, я над ними смеюсь. Но всё это качества, которых вы, по-видимому, полностью лишены.</p>
<p>— Этого, наверно, нельзя сказать ни о ком. Но на протяжении своей жизни я немало потрудился над тем, чтобы избавиться от недостатков, которые могут сделать смешным даже неглупого человека.</p>
<p>— Таких, например, как гордость и тщеславие?</p>
<p>— Да, тщеславие — это в самом деле недостаток. Но гордость… Что ж, тот, кто обладает настоящим умом, может всегда удерживать гордость в должных пределах.</p>
<p>Элизабет отвернулась, чтобы скрыть улыбку.</p>
<p>— Вы как будто успели разобраться в характере мистера Дарси, не так ли? — спросила мисс Бингли. — Хотелось бы узнать ваше мнение.</p>
<p>— Что ж, я вполне убедилась, что мистер Дарси свободен от недостатков. Да он этого и сам не скрывает.</p>
<p>— Подобных притязаний, — ответил Дарси, — я не высказывал. Слабостей у меня достаточно. Я только надеюсь, что от них избавлен мой ум. А вот за нрав свой я бы не поручился. Возможно, я недостаточно мягок — во всяком случае, с точки зрения удобства тех, кто меня окружает. Я не умею забывать глупость и пороки ближних так быстро, как следовало бы, так же, как и нанесенные мне обиды. Я не способен расчувствоваться, как только меня захотят растрогать. Меня, вероятно, можно назвать обидчивым. Если кто-нибудь лишается моего уважения, то уже навсегда.</p>
<p>— Вот это в самом деле серьезный порок! — воскликнула Элизабет. — Неумеренная обидчивость — безусловно, отрицательная черта характера. Но вы удачно выбрали свой недостаток. Смеяться над ним я не способна. Вы можете меня не бояться.</p>
<p>— Наверно, всякому человеку свойственна склонность к какому-то недостатку, — природная слабость не может быть преодолена даже отличным воспитанием.</p>
<p>— Ваша слабость — это готовность ненавидеть людей.</p>
<p>— А ваша, — отвечал он с улыбкой, — намеренно их не понимать.</p>
<p>— Мне хочется немножко послушать музыку, — сказала мисс Бингли, устав прислушиваться к разговору, в котором она не принимала участия. — Луиза, ты не рассердишься, если я разбужу твоего мужа?</p>
<p>Ее сестра ничего не имела против, и Кэролайн подняла крышку фортепьяно. Дарси, поразмыслив, не стал об этом жалеть, так как чувствовал, что уделяет Элизабет слишком много внимания.</p>
<p></span><span id="id13"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XII</p>
</div>
<p>Как было условлено между сестрами, наутро Элизабет написала матери, чтобы за ними в этот же день прислали экипаж. Миссис Беннет, однако, рассчитывала, что ее дочери останутся в Незерфилде до вторника, с тем чтобы Джейн провела там целую неделю, и, следовательно, не испытывала никакого удовольствия от того, что они собираются приехать раньше. Ее ответ поэтому оказался мало благоприятным — по крайней мере, для Элизабет, с нетерпением ждавшей возвращения домой. В письме говорилось, что миссис Беннет едва ли удастся послать экипаж раньше вторника, причем в постскриптуме добавлялось, что, если мистер Бингли и его сестры станут уговаривать их остаться подольше, она отлично обойдется без старших дочерей и более долгое время. Элизабет, однако, и думать не могла о задержке — она даже не вполне была уверена в том, что их об этом попросят. Напротив, боясь, как бы не показалось, что их пребывание затянулось, она стала уговаривать Джейн сразу же попросить экипаж у Бингли. В конце концов было решено сказать, что им хотелось бы вернуться домой в это же утро, и одновременно обратиться с просьбой об экипаже.</p>
<p>Известие об их отъезде вызвало всеобщее сожаление. При этом была высказана уверенность, что для полного выздоровления больной им следует пробыть в Незерфилде хотя бы еще один день. И под конец сестры согласились задержаться до следующего утра. Мисс Бингли вскоре стала жалеть о том, что предложила отложить их отъезд, так как ревность и неприязнь, вызванные в ней одной из сестер, были гораздо сильнее ее привязанности ко второй.</p>
<p>Хозяин дома был искренне опечален предстоящей разлукой и горячо доказывал мисс Беннет, что она недостаточно поправилась для переезда. Но тщетно — Джейн, когда она была уверена в правильности своих действий, умела проявить твердость.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси был доволен этим решением. Элизабет пробыла в Незерфилде достаточно долго. Чары ее действовали на него гораздо сильнее, чем ему бы хотелось. К тому же мисс Бингли была с ней чересчур резка, а к самому Дарси приставала чаще, чем в обычные дни. Он весьма мудро рассудил, что ему следует избегать всяческих знаков внимания по отношению к Элизабет, которые позволили бы ей заподозрить, что от нее может зависеть его счастье. При этом он сознавал, что, если подобные догадки уже успели зародиться в ее голове, их подтверждение в значительной степени зависит от того, как он себя поведет накануне ее отъезда. Укрепившись в своем намерении, он сказал ей за всю субботу не более десятка слов, и, хотя им пришлось около получаса пробыть вдвоем в одной комнате, он в течение всего времени с таким усердием читал книгу, что даже не взглянул в ее сторону.</p>
<p>В воскресенье, сразу после утреннего богослужения, наступила наконец желанная для большинства минута разлуки. Любезность мисс Бингли к Элизабет, так же как и ее привязанность к Джейн, перед самым отъездом заметно возросли. При расставании старшую сестру заверили, что встреча с ней — в Лонгборне или Незерфилде — всегда будет радостным событием. После того как мисс Бингли нежнейшим образом обняла Джейн и даже протянула руку ее сестре, Элизабет рассталась со всей компанией в прекрасном расположении духа.</p>
<p>Мать встретила их не очень приветливо. Миссис Беннет была удивлена их приездом, полагая, что они весьма неразумно причинили всем столько хлопот, и не сомневалась, что Джейн опять заболеет. Отец, напротив, хотя и в сдержанной форме, дал им понять, что он доволен их возвращением — ему сильно не хватало старших дочерей при семейных беседах. В отсутствие Джейн и Элизабет вечерние разговоры потеряли значительную часть своего остроумия и почти весь свой смысл.</p>
<p>Они застали Мэри, как обычно, погруженной в изучение музыкальной гармонии и основ человеческой природы и выслушали несколько новых цитат и нравоучительных изречений. Совсем в ином роде были сообщения Кэтрин и Лидии. С прошлой среды в полку произошло множество событий: несколько офицеров обедали у их дядюшки, был подвергнут телесному наказанию рядовой и распространились самые упорные слухи, что полковник Форстер намерен жениться.</p>
<p></span><span id="id14"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XIII</p>
</div>
<p>— Надеюсь, моя дорогая, вы позаботились, чтобы у нас был сегодня хороший обед? — спросил на следующее утро за завтраком мистер Беннет. — Я полагаю, что за нашим столом может появиться некое новое лицо.</p>
<p>— О ком вы говорите, мой друг? Насколько мне известно, никто к нам не собирается. Разве заглянет Шарлотта Лукас… Но для нее, я надеюсь, наши обеды всегда достаточно хороши. Не думаю, чтобы она особенно привыкла к подобному столу у себя дома.</p>
<p>— Я имею в виду приезжего джентльмена.</p>
<p>Глаза миссис Беннет заблестели.</p>
<p>— Приезжего джентльмена? Уверена, что это мистер Бингли! Ах, Джейн, негодница, как же ты не сказала раньше? Ну что ж, я буду рада увидеть мистера Бингли. Но, боже мой, какой ужас — у нас не будет рыбного блюда! Лидия, душенька моя, дерни, пожалуйста, колокольчик. Надо сию же минуту отдать распоряжение миссис Хилл.</p>
<p>— Речь идет не о мистере Бингли, — отвечал ее муж. — Я жду человека, которого еще никогда не видел.</p>
<p>Слова эти вызвали общее удивление, и, к полному удовольствию мистера Беннета, все члены семейства забросали его вопросами. Позабавившись всеобщим любопытством, он в конце концов дал следующее разъяснение:</p>
<p>— Около месяца назад я получил вот эту эпистолу, на которую ответил две недели спустя. Дело казалось настолько тонким, что я предпочел его предварительно обдумать. Ее написал мой кузен, мистер Коллинз, тот самый, который после моей смерти сможет вышвырнуть вас из этого дома, как только ему заблагорассудится.</p>
<p>— Ах, мой друг, — воскликнула миссис Беннет, — я о нем не желаю слышать! Ради бога, не говорите об этом чудовище. Можно ли совершить что-нибудь более несправедливое, чем выгнать из принадлежавшего вам имения собственных ваших детей? Будь я на вашем месте, я бы, конечно, уже давно постаралась что-нибудь предпринять.</p>
<p>Джейн и Элизабет попытались объяснить матери сущность закона о майорате. Подобные попытки делались ими и раньше. Но предмет этот выходил за пределы ее разумения, и она продолжала горько сетовать на жестокость законов, отнимающих дом у семьи с пятью дочерьми в пользу человека, до которого никому нет ни малейшего дела.</p>
<p>— Это, конечно, крайне несправедливо, — сказал мистер Беннет. — И мистеру Коллинзу ничем не удастся снять с себя вины в наследовании Лонгборна. Однако, если вы позволите мне прочесть его послание, быть может, вас несколько примирит с ним тон, в котором оно написано.</p>
<p>— Уверена, что со мной этого не случится! Как вообще у него хватило наглости и лицемерия вам писать! Терпеть не могу фальшивых друзей! Лучше бы он враждовал с вами, подобно его отцу.</p>
<p>— Вы услышите, что он и впрямь ощущает некоторые сыновние обязательства в этом смысле:</p>
<p><em>«Хансфорд, около Уэстерхема,</em></p>
<p><em>Кент,</em></p>
<p><em>15 октября</em></p>
<p>Дорогой сэр, недоразумения, существовавшие между Вами и моим высокочтимым покойным родителем, причиняли мне всегда много огорчений, и с тех пор, как я имел несчастье его потерять, я не раз испытывал желание устранить разделяющую нас пропасть. В течение некоторого времени меня все же одолевали сомнения, как бы я нечаянно не оскорбил память отца, установив хорошие отношения с теми, с кем ему было угодно находиться в размолвке».</p>
<p>— Вы видите, миссис Беннет!</p>
<p>«Однако теперь у меня созрело решение. Приняв на прошлую пасху пасторский сан, я оказался тем счастливым смертным, который удостоился прихода в поместье ее светлости леди Кэтрин де Бёр, вдовы сэра Льюиса де Бёра. Благодаря щедрости и благорасположению этой леди я стал священником здешнего прихода, в каковой роли моим самым искренним стремлением будет вести себя с надлежащим уважением по отношению к ее светлости и осуществлять обряды и церемонии, подобающие пастырю англиканской церкви. В качестве служителя церкви я также считаю своим долгом сеять мир и благоволение среди всех семейств, на которые может простираться мое влияние. По этой причине я льщу себя надеждой, что Вы благожелательно отнесетесь к моему настоящему изъявлению доброй воли и не отвергнете протянутую мною оливковую ветвь, великодушно закрыв глаза на то, что я являюсь наследником Лонгборна. Я весьма печалюсь о том, что невольно служу орудием нанесения ущерба благополучию Ваших прелестных дочерей, и, позволяя себе принести им мои извинения, спешу также заверить Вас в моей готовности сделать все от меня зависящее, чтобы как-то восполнить этот ущерб… Но об этом позднее. Если у Вас не будет возражений против моего визита, я доставлю себе удовольствие посетить Вас и Ваше семейство в понедельник 18 ноября в четыре часа и воспользоваться Вашим гостеприимством, возможно, до субботы на следующей неделе, — что я могу себе позволить без существенных жертв, ибо леди Кэтрин отнюдь не возражает против того, чтобы я изредка отсутствовал в воскресенье, разумеется, если какое-нибудь другое духовное лицо выполнит за меня подобающие этому дню церковные обязанности.</p>
<p>Остаюсь, дорогой сэр, с почтительнейшим поклоном Вашей супруге и дочерям.</p>
<p><em>Ваш доброжелатель и друг</em></p>
<p><em>Уильям Коллинз».</em></p>
<p><em>—</em> Итак, в четыре часа мы можем ждать у себя этого миротворца, — сказал мистер Беннет, складывая письмо. — По-видимому, он необычайно добропорядочный и благовоспитанный молодой человек. Я полагаю, мы будем дорожить этим знакомством, особенно если леди Кэтрин и впредь будет столь любезно отпускать его в наши края.</p>
<p>— В том, что он пишет о наших девочках, есть, мне кажется, какой-то смысл. Если он хочет что-то для них сделать, я не собираюсь его отговаривать.</p>
<p>— Трудно представить, — сказала Джейн, — как он собирается восполнить наносимый нам ущерб. Но уже одно такое желание делает ему честь.</p>
<p>Элизабет больше всего бросилось в глаза его крайнее почтение к леди Кэтрин и добрые намерения крестить, венчать и хоронить, по мере надобности, свою паству.</p>
<p>— Ну и диковина, должно быть, этот наш троюродный братец, — сказала она. — Сразу его и не поймешь. Что за напыщенный слог! И для чего он вздумал извиняться в своих наследственных правах? Трудно поверить, чтобы он нам помог, даже если бы был на это способен. Вы думаете, сэр, он человек разумный?</p>
<p>— Нет, моя дорогая, совсем не думаю. Я предвкушаю нечто прямо противоположное. Письмо его — такая смесь раболепия и самодовольства, которая служит прекрасным предзнаменованием. Потому-то мне очень любопытно на него посмотреть.</p>
<p>— Что касается стиля, — сказала Мэри, — его письмо безукоризненно. Идея об оливковой ветви, пожалуй, не блещет новизной, но выражена неплохо.</p>
<p>Для Кэтрин и Лидии письмо и его автор не представляли ни малейшего интереса. Нельзя было ожидать, что кузен появится в алом мундире, а за последние недели общество мужчин в одежде другого цвета не доставляло им никакого удовольствия. Прочитанное письмо настолько рассеяло в душе миссис Беннет недоброжелательство по отношению к мистеру Коллинзу, что она усердно стала готовиться к встрече, чем немало удивила мужа и дочерей.</p>
<p>Мистер Коллинз прибыл точно в назначенное время и был принят всей семьей с большим радушием. Хозяин дома, правда, ограничился лишь кратким приветствием, зато дамы были достаточно словоохотливы, а мистер Коллинз не нуждался в ободрении и не отличался молчаливостью. Он оказался высоким и полным молодым человеком лет двадцати пяти, важного вида и с солидными манерами. Не прошло и нескольких минут знакомства, как он уже преподнес миссис Беннет комплимент по поводу необычайной красоты ее дочерей, о которой слышал так много. При этом он признался, что в данном случае молва даже приуменьшила истинные их достоинства, и выразил уверенность, что они в недалеком будущем сделают прекрасные партии. Такая галантность пришлась, правда, не совсем по вкусу некоторым из его слушателей. Но миссис Беннет, которой всякий комплимент доставлял удовольствие, приняла его вполне благосклонно.</p>
<p>— Вы в самом деле, сэр, очень добры. Я всей душой желаю, чтобы ваше предсказание сбылось, — иначе их ждет печальная судьба. Обстоятельства сложились так нелепо!..</p>
<p>— Быть может, вы имеете в виду мои наследственные права?</p>
<p>— О, сэр, разумеется! Вы сами понимаете, как это ужасно для моих бедных девочек. Я вовсе не считаю вас виноватым — такие вещи зависят только от случая. Когда имение переходит по мужской линии, оно может достаться кому угодно.</p>
<p>— Я, сударыня, вполне сочувствую моим прелестным кузинам в связи с этим неблагоприятным обстоятельством и мог бы нечто сказать по этому поводу. Однако, чтобы не опережать событий, я пока воздержусь. Могу только заверить молодых леди, что я прибыл сюда, готовый восхищаться их красотой. Сейчас я ничего не прибавлю, но когда мы познакомимся ближе…</p>
<p>Тут его речь была прервана приглашением к обеду. Барышни пересмеивались друг с другом. Их красота была не единственным предметом восхищения мистера Коллинза. Гостиная, столовая, обстановка — все подверглось внимательному осмотру и получило высокую оценку. Похвалы эти, несомненно, тронули бы миссис Беннет, если бы ее душу не леденила мысль, что мистер Коллинз смотрит на все как на свою будущую собственность. Обед, в свою очередь, вызвал поток самых восторженных суждений, причем мистер Коллинз пожелал узнать, кулинарным способностям какой из его кузин они обязаны столь отменными кушаньями. Тут, однако, хозяйка дома поставила гостя на место, с достоинством заявив, что она вполне может держать хорошего повара и что ее дочерям нечего делать на кухне. Гость не преминул попросить у нее прощения за допущенный промах, и миссис Беннет, смягчившись, сказала, что нисколько на него не обиделась. Однако мистер Коллинз еще в течение четверти часа продолжал извиняться.</p>
<p></span><span id="id15"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XIV</p>
</div>
<p>На протяжении всего обеда мистер Беннет почти ни с кем не разговаривал. Но когда прислуга удалилась, он решил, что для беседы с гостем наступило подходящее время. Коснувшись темы, которая, несомненно, должна была воспламенить мистера Коллинза, он заметил, что последний, по-видимому, очень доволен своей патронессой. Сочувствие леди Кэтрин де Бёр всем его желаниям и ее забота об удобствах мистера Коллинза кажутся на первый взгляд из ряда вон выходящими. Мистер Беннет едва ли мог найти более удачный предмет для разговора. Гость говорил о леди де Бёр с величайшим восторгом. Тема эта сделала его слог необычно высокопарным даже для него самого. С полной убежденностью он объявил, что за всю жизнь ему не приходилось наблюдать подобного поведения высокопоставленных особ — такой снисходительности и благосклонности, с какими отнеслась к нему леди Кэтрин. Она милостиво одобрила обе его проповеди, которые он уже имел честь произнести в ее присутствии. Дважды она приглашала его к обеду в Розингсе и всего только неделю назад присылала за ним, чтобы он принял участие в ее вечерней игре в кадриль<a href="#ref27" class="a" onclick="save();">[14]</a>. Многие, как известно, находят, что леди Кэтрин не в меру горда. Однако по отношению к нему она всегда была необыкновенно приветлива. Ее светлость всегда разговаривала с ним так же, как с любым другим джентльменом. Она ничуть не возражала ни против его знакомства с окрестным обществом, ни против того, чтобы он время от времени оставлял на неделю-другую приход ради визита к родственникам. Она даже снизошла до того, что порекомендовала ему по возможности поскорее жениться, конечно, с подобающей осмотрительностью, а однажды посетила мистера Коллинза в его скромном обиталище. Там она вполне одобрила все предпринятые им усовершенствования и даже снабдила его кое-какими советами по части устройства полок в каморке на втором этаже.</p>
<p>— Все это необыкновенно похвально с ее стороны и, разумеется, крайне любезно, — заметила миссис Беннет. — Осмелюсь сказать, это, должно быть, чрезвычайно приятная женщина. Как жаль, что большинство важных дам на нее не похожи! И она живет, сэр, неподалеку от вас?</p>
<p>— Сад, в котором находится мое скромное обиталище, только аллеей отделен от Розингс-парка — резиденции ее светлости.</p>
<p>— Вы как будто сказали, что она вдова, сэр? Есть ли у нее дети?</p>
<p>— У нее всего одна дочь — наследница Розингса, весьма значительного имения.</p>
<p>— Увы, — воскликнула миссис Беннет, покачав головой. — В таком случае она гораздо счастливее многих других барышень. А что собой представляет эта благородная особа? Хороша ли она собой?</p>
<p>— Воистину это очаровательнейшая юная леди! Ее мать, леди Кэтрин, сама говорит, что по части красоты мисс де Бёр намного превзошла других прелестнейших представительниц своего пола, так как в ней есть что-то такое, что сразу отличает молодую особу высокого происхождения. К несчастью, у нее довольно слабое сложение, которое помешало ей преуспеть во многих искусствах. По мнению дамы, занимавшейся ее воспитанием, мисс де Бёр пошла бы весьма далеко, будь только она покрепче здоровьем. И она настолько мила, что нередко удостаивает своим посещением мое скромное обиталище, когда выезжает на прогулку в своем запряженном пони маленьком фаэтоне.</p>
<p>— Она уже была представлена ко двору? Я не встречала ее имени в списках придворных дам.</p>
<p>— Увы, здоровье, к несчастью, не позволяет ей переселиться в город. Это обстоятельство, как я однажды уже сказал самой леди Кэтрин, лишило двор Британии его лучшего украшения. Ее светлости очень понравилось мое замечание. Должен признаться, я часто прибегаю к такого рода изящным комплиментам, которые столь нравятся дамам. Например, я не раз говаривал леди Кэтрин, что ее прелестная дочь рождена, чтобы стать герцогиней и украсить собой любое место, которое само украсило бы всякую другую особу. Я считаю священным долгом свидетельствовать подобными милыми мелочами свое внимание к ее светлости.</p>
<p>— Вы рассуждаете весьма здраво, — сказал мистер Беннет. — И ваше счастье, что вы обладаете талантом льстить с такой деликатностью. А позвольте спросить, — рождаются ли у вас эти милые свидетельства внимания в результате мгновенного проблеска мысли или вы их придумываете заблаговременно?</p>
<p>— Обычно они всегда имеют отношение к происходящему. И хотя иногда, ради развлечения, я на досуге занимаюсь изобретением изящных маленьких сюрпризов, которые могут подойти к различным случаям жизни, но, преподнося их, я всегда стараюсь придать им форму экспромта.</p>
<p>Ожидания мистера Беннета целиком подтвердились. Глупость кузена вполне оправдала его надежды. И, слушая гостя с серьезнейшим выражением лица, он от души развлекался. При этом, если не считать редких случаев, когда он бросал взгляд на Элизабет, он вовсе не нуждался в партнере, с которым мог бы разделить удовольствие.</p>
<p>Ко времени вечернего чаепития принятая им доза оказалась, однако, уже настолько значительной, что мистер Беннет был рад спровадить своего кузена в гостиную, попросив его почитать что-нибудь дамам. Мистер Коллинз с готовностью согласился, и ему была принесена книга. Однако, взглянув на нее (легко было видеть, что это книга из общественной библиотеки<a href="#ref25" class="a" onclick="save();">[15]</a>), он сразу же от нее отпрянул и, попросив прощения, заявил, что никогда не читает романов. Китти изумленно на него уставилась, а Лидия даже от удивления вскрикнула. Были извлечены другие книги, и после некоторого раздумья он остановился на проповедях Фордайса<a href="#ref24" class="a" onclick="save();">[16]</a>. Как только том был раскрыт, Лидию одолела зевота. И не успел он прочесть монотонным голосом трех страниц, как она, перебив его на полуслове, воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Вы слышали, мама, дядя Филипс хочет уволить Ричарда? Если он на это решится, Ричарда сразу возьмет к себе полковник Форстер. Мне об этом в субботу сказала тетушка. Нужно будет завтра же сходить в Меритон и расспросить обо всем подробнее. А заодно узнать, когда же вернется из города мистер Денни.</p>
<p>Две старшие сестры попросили Лидию придержать язык, но мистер Коллинз, оскорбленный до глубины души, отложил книгу и сказал:</p>
<p>— Мне часто приходилось наблюдать, как мало интересуют молодых леди книги серьезного содержания, написанные, увы, для их же пользы. И, признаюсь, меня это удивляет. В самом деле, может ли быть для них что-нибудь благотворнее хорошего нравоучения? Но я больше не стану утруждать слух моих юных кузин… — И, повернувшись к мистеру Беннету, он предложил ему сыграть партию в триктрак<a href="#ref23" class="a" onclick="save();">[17]</a>. Мистер Беннет принял приглашение, заметив, что кузен поступает весьма разумно, предоставляя девчонкам заниматься своими пустячными забавами. Миссис Беннет и ее дочери самым искренним образом извинились за выходку Лидии, обещая, если он возобновит чтение, впредь не допустить ничего подобного. Однако, сказав, что он не затаил против юной кузины ни малейшей обиды и что ее поступок вовсе не был для него оскорбителен, мистер Коллинз уселся с мистером Беннетом за другой столик и приготовился к игре.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА XV</p>
</div>
<p>Мистер Коллинз не был одаренной натурой. И это упущение природы не было восполнено в нем воспитанием и общением с людьми. Большую часть жизни он провел под надзором отца — человека необразованного и мелочного. Находясь в университете, он прослушал курс наук, но не завел сколько-нибудь полезных знакомств. Подавленный отцовским воспитанием, первоначально привившим его характеру раболепие, он приобрел со временем самодовольство недалекого человека, который живет сам по себе и неожиданно рано преуспел в жизни. Благодаря счастливой случайности он подвернулся вдове сэра Льюиса де Бёра в тот момент, когда освободился хансфордский приход. Почтение к ее высокому рангу, благоговение перед личностью патронессы и вместе с тем высокое мнение о собственной персоне, авторитете священнослужителя и правах главы церковного прихода сделали из него человека, в характере которого своеобразно переплелись высокомерие и угодничество, самодовольство и униженность.</p>
<p>Обзаведясь приличным жильем и вполне достаточным доходом, он возымел намерение жениться. В поисках же примирения с семьей мистера Беннета он задумал взять себе в жены одну из его дочерей, при условии, если знакомство с ними подтвердит дошедшие до него сведения об их красоте и благонравии. В этом-то и заключался его план восполнения ущерба, который наносился семье Беннет его наследственными правами. Сам мистер Коллинз считал, что ему пришел в голову необыкновенно удачный и для всех приемлемый план, который свидетельствовал в то же время о его великодушии, ибо не представлял для него никакой личной выгоды.</p>
<p>План этот не изменился после того, как он познакомился с семьей своего родственника. Созерцание прелестного личика мисс Беннет-старшей, напротив, укрепило мистера Коллинза в его намерениях, подтвердив в то же время его строгие взгляды на права, связанные со старшинством. Таким образом, в течение первого вечера его избранницей сделалась Джейн. Следующее утро, однако, внесло в его замыслы некоторую поправку. Перед завтраком он провел четверть часа tete-a-tete с миссис Беннет. Беседа между ними коснулась пасторского дома в Хансфорде и, естественным образом, перешла к надежде мистера Коллинза найти будущую хозяйку этого дома в Лонгборне. И среди приятнейших улыбок, свидетельствовавших, что она, вообще говоря, вполне одобряет его намерения, миссис Беннет смогла все же предостеречь гостя в отношении той своей дочери, на которой он было остановил свой выбор: она-де ничего не может позволить себе сказать в отношении младших девочек, — возможно, она недостаточно осведомлена, — но ей неизвестно о существовании у них каких-либо душевных привязанностей. Что же касается старшей дочери, — она просто должна предупредить его, так как чувствует себя обязанной по отношению к Джейн, — весьма вероятно, что в скором времени она будет обручена.</p>
<p>Мистеру Коллинзу потребовалось только сменить одну кузину на другую. И это было сделано за то время, пока миссис Беннет перемешивала угли в камине. Почти равная Джейн годами и внешностью, Элизабет стала естественной преемницей прав старшей сестры.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет высоко оценила намерения, на которые намекал мистер Коллинз, поверив, что в скором времени у нее будут две замужние дочери. И человек, имени которого она еще накануне не могла слышать, приобрел теперь ее полное расположение.</p>
<p>Лидия не забыла о своем желании отправиться в Меритон, и вместе с нею решили прогуляться также все ее сестры, кроме Мэри. По просьбе мистера Беннета мистер Коллинз должен был их сопровождать. Хозяину дома очень хотелось от него избавиться и получить в свое распоряжение библиотеку, куда гость последовал за ним после завтрака и где, якобы заинтересованный одной из самых толстых книг, он почти без перерыва докучал своему родственнику болтовней о доме и саде в Хансфорде. Такое поведение кузена совершенно вывело мистера Беннета из терпения. В библиотеке он всегда мог найти покой и тишину. И хотя, как мистер Беннет признавался Элизабет, он постоянно был готов столкнуться с проявлениями глупости и самодовольства в любой другой части дома, здесь он привык от них отдыхать. Поэтому предложение совершить прогулку с девицами Беннет было высказано мистеру Коллинзу самым настоятельным образом. Более расположенный к прогулке, чем к чтению, мистер Коллинз с не меньшей охотой это предложение принял и тут же захлопнул свой огромный фолиант.</p>
<p>Разговор по пути в Меритон почти все время поддерживал один мистер Коллинз, высокопарная болтовня которого лишь изредка прерывалась вежливыми замечаниями его кузин. Однако, очутившись в городке, младшие сестры совершенно перестали обращать на него внимание и принялись оглядываться по сторонам в поисках офицеров, так что отвлечь их от этого занятия могли только выставленная в окне лавки особенно нарядная шляпка или образчик только что привезенного муслина.</p>
<p>Внимание барышень вскоре привлек неизвестный молодой человек благородной наружности, который прогуливался вместе с каким-то офицером по противоположной стороне улицы. Когда они поравнялись, офицер поклонился. Это был сам мистер Денни, о времени приезда которого Лидия хотела разузнать в Меритоне. Его спутник произвел на девиц неотразимое впечатление, и они принялись гадать, кто бы это мог оказаться. Китти и Лидия решили выяснить это не откладывая и пересекли улицу, как бы направляясь в находившуюся неподалеку лавку. Им посчастливилось перейти на другую сторону как раз в ту минуту, когда молодые люди, повернув назад, подошли к тому же самому месту. Мистер Денни сразу с ними заговорил, попросив разрешения представить своего друга, мистера Уикхема, который прибыл с ним накануне в Меритон и, как он счастлив сообщить, был зачислен в их полк. Все складывалось самым благоприятным образом, ибо, чтобы стать окончательно неотразимым, молодому человеку не хватало лишь полкового мундира. Внешность его вполне располагала в его пользу. В ней все было хорошо: правильные черты лица, отличная фигура, приятные манеры. Представленный дамам, он сразу обнаружил склонность к непринужденной беседе — счастливую склонность, в которой не чувствовалось ни малейшей искусственности. Компания продолжала стоять, любезно болтая, когда послышалось цоканье копыт и вдали показались скакавшие вдоль улицы Дарси и Бингли. Увидев знакомых дам, всадники подъехали ближе и засвидетельствовали им свое почтение. Говорил главным образом Бингли, речь которого почти целиком была обращена к старшей мисс Беннет. По его словам, они направлялись в Лонгборн, чтобы осведомиться о ее здоровье. Мистер Дарси подтвердил это кивком головы и, вспомнив о своем намерении не засматриваться на Элизабет, внезапно остановил взгляд на незнакомце. Элизабет, которая в это время случайно посмотрела на того и другого, была поражена действием на них этой встречи; оба изменились в лице — один побледнел, другой покраснел. Через несколько секунд мистер Уикхем притронулся рукой к шляпе — приветствие, на которое мистер Дарси едва ответил. Что это могло означать? Придумать этому объяснение было невозможно. И так же невозможно было удержаться от желания проникнуть в скрывавшуюся за этим тайну.</p>
<p>Через минуту мистер Бингли попрощался и ускакал вместе со своим другом, как будто так и не заметив происшедшего.</p>
<p>Мистер Денни и мистер Уикхем проводили молодых леди до дома мистера Филипса и здесь раскланялись с ними, несмотря на настойчивые приглашения Лидии зайти в дом, поддержанные громкими восклицаниями высунувшейся из окна миссис Филипс.</p>
<p>Эта дама всегда была рада видеть своих племянниц. А недавнее отсутствие двух старших мисс Беннет делало приход Джейн и Элизабет особенно желанным. Она тут же стала говорить о том, как удивило ее их раннее возвращение в Лонгборн. Они вернулись в чужом экипаже, и миссис Филипс могла бы об этом ничего не узнать, не попадись ей на улице мальчишка из аптеки мистера Джонса, который сказал, что он больше не носит лекарств в Незерфилд, так как обе мисс Беннет оттуда уехали. В эту минуту ее внимание было привлечено к мистеру Коллинзу, которого ей представила Джейн. Миссис Филипс встретила его самым любезным образом, на что гость отвечал еще большей любезностью. Извиняясь за то, что он вторгся в дом, не имея чести быть с ней знакомым, мистер Коллинз льстил себя надеждой, что его поступок может быть все же оправдан родством с молодыми леди, представившими его ее вниманию. Миссис Филипс почувствовала благоговение перед столь воспитанным гостем. Однако ее тут же отвлекли от одного незнакомца расспросами относительно другого, о котором она, увы, могла сообщить своим племянницам только уже известные им сведения: что его привез из Лондона мистер Денни и что он собирается вступить лейтенантом в ***ширский полк. По ее словам, она вела наблюдения за ним уже в течение часа, пока он разгуливал по их улице, и если бы мистер Уикхем снова оказался перед окнами, Китти и Лидия, несомненно, тотчас бы продолжили это занятие. К несчастью, однако, на улице не появилось больше никого, кроме одного-двух офицеров, которые, по сравнению с заинтересовавшим их юношей, показались «невзрачными и не стоящими внимания». Кое-кто из полка должен был на следующий день прийти к Филипсам, и тетушка взялась уговорить мужа, чтобы он позвал также мистера Уикхема, если к ней приедут ее родственники из Лонгборна. Приглашение было немедленно принято, и миссис Филипс обещала, что они смогут весело поиграть в лото, прежде чем будет подан легкий горячий ужин. Все были очень обрадованы ожиданием столь приятных развлечений и расстались весьма довольные друг другом. Перед уходом мистер Коллинз снова принес свои извинения, которые были любезно отклонены хозяйкой дома.</p>
<p>По пути в Лонгборн Элизабет рассказала Джейн, что произошло на ее глазах между двумя молодыми людьми. Но так как ее сестра была готова защищать от любого возможного обвинения каждого из них в отдельности и обоих одновременно, понять эту сцену ей было еще труднее.</p>
<p>Мистер Коллинз доставил большое удовольствие их матери, превознося манеры и любезность миссис Филипс. Если не считать леди Кэтрин и мисс де Бёр, он, по его мнению, еще никогда не встречал более благовоспитанной дамы. Мало того, что она так любезно приняла его в своем доме. Она пригласила его еще и на завтрашний вечер, хотя до сих пор он не имел чести быть с ней знакомым. В какой-то степени это объяснялось его родством с семьей Беннет, но все же ему никогда еще не приходилось видеть подобного внимания к своей особе.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id17"></span></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XVI</p>
</div>
<p>Поскольку желание всех мисс Беннет отправиться к тетушке было одобрено их родителями, а возражения мистера Коллинза, опасавшегося покинуть на один вечер хозяина и хозяйку дома, были решительно отклонены, карета в надлежащее время доставила молодого человека и его пять кузин в Меритон. По прибытии барышни с удовольствием узнали, что мистер Уикхем принял приглашение мистера Филипса и уже находится среди гостей.</p>
<p>Когда, выслушав это сообщение, все вступили в гостиную и расселись по местам, мистер Коллинз обрел наконец возможность осмотреться и прийти в восторг от своих наблюдений. По его словам, он был настолько поражен величиной зала и великолепием обстановки, что мог вообразить себя находящимся в меньшей летней комнате для завтрака в самом Розингсе.</p>
<p>Такое сравнение на первый взгляд показалось миссис Филипс не особенно лестным. Однако когда он дал ей понять, что собой представляет Розингс и кому принадлежит это поместье, когда она услышала описание лишь одной из гостиных в доме леди Кэтрин и узнала, что только камин в ней обошелся владелице в восемьсот фунтов, миссис Филипс смогла оценить значение преподнесенного ей комплимента в столь полной мере, что вряд ли была бы даже обижена сравнением своей парадной гостиной с комнатой дворецкого в доме патронессы его преподобия.</p>
<p>Описывая величие леди Кэтрин и ее владений и позволяя себе изредка вставить словечко о собственном скромном обиталище и предпринятых в нем усовершенствованиях, мистер Коллинз весьма приятно провел время до прихода мужчин. В лице миссис Филипс он нашел необыкновенно внимательного слушателя. Мнение этой дамы о его персоне возрастало с каждым словом рассказчика вместе с желанием как можно скорее поделиться полученными сведениями со своими знакомыми. Для девиц, которым уже надоело слушать кузена и которым не оставалось ничего другого, как с нетерпением ждать музыки и рассматривать собственные посредственные имитации китайских рисунков на камине, время тянулось гораздо медленнее. Но вот наконец минуты ожидания кончились. Появились мужчины, и, когда Уикхем вошел в комнату, Элизабет поняла, что она смотрела на него при первой встрече и думала о нем впоследствии не без некоторого бессознательного восхищения. Офицеры ***ширского полка были в большинстве славными молодыми людьми, из которых на вечере присутствовали самые избранные. Однако мистер Уикхем настолько же превосходил любого из них своим видом, фигурой, манерами и походкой, насколько сами они выгодно отличались от вошедшего следом за ними выдыхавшего пары портвейна, располневшего и обрюзгшего дядюшки Филипса.</p>
<p>Мистер Уикхем был тем счастливым представителем мужского пола, к которому обратились глаза всех присутствующих в зале дам. А Элизабет оказалась среди них той счастливицей, возле которой он в конце концов нашел себе место. Усевшись, он тотчас же вступил с ней в беседу, приятнейший характер которой, хотя она и касалась всего-навсего вечерней сырости и приближения дождливой погоды, позволил ей почувствовать, что самая скучная и избитая тема может приобрести значительность при надлежащем искусстве собеседника.</p>
<p>Такие соперники в борьбе за внимание со стороны прекрасного пола, как мистер Уикхем и его приятели-офицеры, заставили мистера Коллинза почти совсем стушеваться. Для барышень он и в самом деле перестал существовать. Однако время от времени он все же обретал чуткого слушателя в лице миссис Филипс и благодаря ее заботам не испытывал недостатка в кофе и булочках.</p>
<p>Когда были расставлены карточные столы, он получил возможность в свою очередь оказать ей любезность, приняв участие в игре.</p>
<p>— Я еще пока недостаточно опытный партнер, — сказал он, — но мне необходимо усовершенствоваться. Ибо при моем положении в жизни…</p>
<p>Миссис Филипс была ему очень признательна за принятое приглашение, но не смогла дослушать его до конца.</p>
<p>Мистер Уикхем не играл в вист и был с восторгом принят за другим столом, где сел между Лидией и Элизабет. Вначале существовала опасность, что способная без умолку болтать Лидия завладеет им полностью. Однако игра интересовала ее ничуть не меньше. И вскоре она настолько увлеклась ею и с таким жаром начала выкрикивать ставки и выигрыши, что перестала обращать внимание на кого бы то ни было. Благодаря этому мистер Уикхем получил возможность, насколько позволяла игра, разговаривать с Элизабет, которая слушала его с большой охотой, хотя и не надеялась, что разговор коснется предмета, интересовавшего ее больше всего — его знакомства с мистером Дарси. Она даже не смела назвать имени этого человека. Совершенно неожиданно, однако, ее любопытство было удовлетворено. Мистер Уикхем сам коснулся этой темы. Осведомившись о расстоянии между Незерфилдом и Меритоном и получив ответ на этот вопрос, он с некоторой неуверенностью спросил, давно ли здесь находится мистер Дарси.</p>
<p>— Около месяца, — сказала Элизабет. И, не желая упустить волновавшую ее тему, добавила: — У него, я слышала, большое имение в Дербишире?</p>
<p>— О да, — ответил Уикхем, — отличное поместье — чистых десять тысяч годовых! Вряд ли вы могли встретить кого-нибудь, кроме меня, кто дал бы вам на этот счет более точные сведения. С его семейством я связан известным образом с раннего детства.</p>
<p>Элизабет не могла не выразить удивления.</p>
<p>— Еще бы вам не удивляться, мисс Беннет! Должны же вы были вчера заметить, как холодно мы с ним встретились. Вы с ним близко знакомы?</p>
<p>— Ровно настолько, чтобы не желать знакомства более близкого! — с чувством ответила Элизабет. — Мне довелось провести с ним под одной кровлей четыре дня, и он показался мне человеком весьма неприятным.</p>
<p>— Не смею судить — приятный или неприятный он человек, — сказал Уикхем. — Мне даже не подобает иметь такого мнения. Слишком долго и хорошо я его знаю, чтобы быть беспристрастным судьей. И все же, мне кажется, ваше мнение о Дарси удивило бы многих. Быть может, где-нибудь в другом месте вы бы его даже не высказали. Здесь, конечно, другое дело. Вы находитесь среди своих…</p>
<p>— Честное слово, я не сказала ничего, что не могла бы повторить в любом доме нашей округи, за исключением Незерфилда. Он никому в Хартфордшире не нравится. Гордость этого человека оттолкнула от него решительно всех. И едва ли вы найдете кого-нибудь, кто отозвался бы о мистере Дарси лучше, чем я.</p>
<p>— Не стану прикидываться огорченным, что мистера Дарси или кого бы то ни было другого оценивают по заслугам, — сказал после небольшой паузы мистер Уикхем. — Однако с мистером Дарси это случается довольно редко. Люди обычно бывают ослеплены его богатством и властью или подавлены его высокомерными барскими замашками. Его видят таким, каким он желает выглядеть сам.</p>
<p>— Даже поверхностное знакомство позволило почувствовать, насколько у него тяжелый характер.</p>
<p>Уикхем только покачал головой.</p>
<p>Когда ему удалось снова заговорить с Элизабет, он спросил:</p>
<p>— И долго мистер Дарси проживет в этих местах?</p>
<p>— Вот уж не знаю. Когда я была в Незерфилде, об его отъезде не говорили. Надеюсь, его пребывание по соседству не отразится на вашем намерении поступить в ***ширский полк?</p>
<p>— О нет! Мне незачем уступать ему дорогу. Пусть сам уезжает, если не хочет со мной встречаться. Мы не состоим в дружеских отношениях, и мне всегда тяжело его видеть. Но других причин избегать его, кроме тех, которые я могу открыть всему свету, не существует. Прежде всего это сознание причиненной мне жестокой обиды. А еще — мне мучительно больно оттого, что он сделался таким человеком. Его отца, покойного мистера Дарси, я считал лучшим из смертных. Он был моим самым близким другом. И меня мучают тысячи трогательнейших воспоминаний, когда судьба сталкивает нас с молодым мистером Дарси. Он причинил мне немало зла. Но я все бы ему простил, если бы он не опозорил память отца и не обманул так сильно его надежд.</p>
<p>Элизабет слушала его, затаив дыхание, чувствуя, что разговор захватывает ее все больше и больше. Однако деликатность темы помешала ее расспросам.</p>
<p>Мистер Уикхем перешел к предметам более общим: к городу Меритону, его окрестностям и, наконец, к его жителям. Одобрив все, что ему удалось повидать, он высказал тонкий, но вполне ощутимый комплимент местному обществу.</p>
<p>— При поступлении в ***ширский полк я прежде всего имел в виду завести здесь постоянные и притом приятные дружеские связи. Я знал, что это прославленная и достойная войсковая часть. Но мой друг Денни особенно соблазнял меня своими рассказами о городе, в котором полк в настоящее время расквартирован. Сколько внимания проявляют здесь к офицерам! И как много приобрели они здесь приятных знакомств! Да, общество, признаюсь, мне необходимо. Я — человек, разочарованный в жизни, и душа моя не терпит одиночества. У меня непременно должны быть занятия и общество. Меня не готовили к военной карьере. Но, волею обстоятельств, теперь это — лучшее, на что я могу рассчитывать. Увы, моей сферой должна была стать церковь. Меня воспитывали для духовной стези. И я бы уже располагал отличным приходом, будь это угодно джентльмену, которого мы упомянули в нашей беседе.</p>
<p>— Неужели это возможно?</p>
<p>— О да, покойный мистер Дарси предназначал для меня лучший приход в своих владениях — сразу же после того, как в нем должна была открыться вакансия. Он был моим крестным отцом и не чаял во мне души. Заботу его обо мне нельзя описать словами. Он так хотел меня обеспечить и верил, что это ему удалось! Но приход освободился и… достался другому.</p>
<p>— Боже правый! — воскликнула Элизабет. — Это неслыханно! Как мог мистер Дарси пренебречь волей отца?! И вы для своей защиты не обратились к закону?</p>
<p>— Формальные недоговоренности в посмертных бумагах не позволили мне искать в нем опоры… Человек чести не усомнился бы в воле покойного, но мистер Дарси предпочел подвергнуть ее своему толкованию. Эту часть завещания он объявил только условной рекомендацией и осмелился утверждать, что я утратил свои права из-за моего легкомыслия, моей расточительности, короче говоря, решительно всех пороков или же попросту никаких. Верно лишь то, что два года тому назад приход оказался свободным, — как раз тогда, когда я по возрасту мог этим воспользоваться, — но я его не получил. И столь же верно, что я не могу обвинить себя в каком-нибудь проступке, из-за которого я должен был бы его лишиться. У меня горячий, несдержанный нрав. И, быть может, я слишком вольно высказывал свое мнение о молодом Дарси, признаюсь, иногда даже прямо ему в лицо. Ничего худшего я не припомню. Все дело в том, что мы с ним слишком разные люди и что он меня ненавидит.</p>
<p>— Но это чудовищно! Он заслуживает публичного осуждения!</p>
<p>— Рано или поздно он этого дождется. Но это не будет исходить от меня. Пока я помню Дарси-отца, я не могу очернить или разоблачить Дарси-сына.</p>
<p>Элизабет вполне оценила его благородные чувства, отметив про себя, как хорош он был в тот момент, когда о них говорил. После некоторой паузы она спросила:</p>
<p>— Но какие же у него для этого могли оказаться причины? Что толкнуло его на столь гнусный поступок?</p>
<p>— Решительная и глубокая неприязнь ко мне. Неприязнь, которую я не могу в какой-то мере не приписывать чувству ревности. Если бы покойный мистер Дарси любил меня не так сильно, его сын, быть может, относился бы ко мне лучше. Но необычайная привязанность ко мне отца стала, по-видимому, раздражать сына с раннего возраста. Ему не нравилось возникшее между нами своеобразное соперничество, и он не мог смириться с тем, что мне нередко оказывалось предпочтение.</p>
<p>— Мне и в голову не приходило, что мистер Дарси такой недостойный человек. Честно говоря, он мне и раньше не нравился. И все же так плохо я о нем не судила. Конечно, я замечала, с каким презрением он относится к окружающим. Но я никогда не предполагала, что он способен на такую низкую месть, такую несправедливость, такую бесчеловечность.</p>
<p>Подумав, она добавила:</p>
<p>— Я, правда, припоминаю, как однажды в Незерфилде он признался в своей неумеренной обидчивости и злопамятстве. Что за ужасный характер!..</p>
<p>— Не стану высказывать своего мнения по этому поводу, — ответил Уикхем. — Мне трудно быть к нему справедливым.</p>
<p>Элизабет снова погрузилась в раздумье и после некоторой паузы воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Так обойтись с крестником, другом, любимцем родного отца! — Она могла бы добавить: «С юношей, самая внешность которого располагает к нему людей с первого взгляда», — но ограничилась словами: — С человеком, который к тому же с самого детства был его ближайшим товарищем! И который, как я вас поняла, связан с ним теснейшими узами!</p>
<p>— Мы родились в одном приходе, в одном и том же поместье. И провели вместе детские годы — жили под одной кровлей, играли в одни игры, радовались общей отеческой ласке. В юности мой отец избрал тот жизненный путь, на котором с таким успехом продвигается ваш дядюшка, мистер Филипс. Но он пренебрег всем, стремясь оказаться полезным покойному мистеру Дарси, и посвятил свою жизнь заботам о Пемберли. Зато как высоко ценил его мистер Дарси! Какими задушевными друзьями были наши отцы! Мистер Дарси всегда признавал, скольким он обязан своему другу. И незадолго до смерти моего отца мистер Дарси по собственной воле обещал ему обеспечить мое будущее. Он поступил так, я убежден, столько же из чувства благодарности к отцу, сколько и из привязанности к сыну.</p>
<p>— Неслыханно! — воскликнула Элизабет. — Чудовищно! Казалось бы, одна лишь гордость должна была заставить младшего мистера Дарси выполнить по отношению к вам свой долг! Если ему несвойственны лучшие чувства, то как его гордость позволила ему поступить так бесчестно? О да, бесчестно — его поведению нет другого названия!</p>
<p>— Это и в самом деле странно, — подтвердил Уикхем. — Ведь почти все его поступки так или иначе объясняются гордостью. Гордость нередко была его лучшим советчиком. Из всех чувств она его больше всего приблизила к добродетели. Но не бывает ведь правил без исключений: в отношениях со мной им руководили более сильные побуждения.</p>
<p>— Неужели его непомерная гордость когда-нибудь могла принести ему пользу?</p>
<p>— О да. Она часто заставляла его поступать снисходительно и великодушно — щедро раздавать деньги, оказывать гостеприимство, поддерживать арендаторов, помогать бедным. Всему этому способствовала фамильная гордость и сыновняя гордость — настолько он гордится своим отцом. Опасение лишить былой славы свой род, ослабить влияние и популярность дома Пемберли сыграло немалую роль в его жизни. Ему свойственна и гордость старшего брата, которая в соединении с известной братской привязанностью сделала из него доброго и внимательного опекуна своей сестры. И вы могли бы услышать, как его называют самым лучшим и заботливым братом.</p>
<p>— А что собой представляет мисс Дарси?</p>
<p>Он покачал головой.</p>
<p>— Как бы хотелось отозваться о ней хорошо! С именем Дарси больно связывать что-то дурное. Но, увы, она слишком похожа на своего брата — так завладела ею гордыня. А какая это была милая, ласковая маленькая девочка, как нежно она была ко мне привязана! И кто скажет — сколько часов потратил я, заботясь о ее развлечениях? Теперь она для меня — ничто. Это довольно смазливая девица лет пятнадцати — шестнадцати, получившая, насколько я могу судить, недурное воспитание. С тех пор как скончался ее отец, она постоянно живет в Лондоне в обществе какой-то дамы, которая руководит ее занятиями.</p>
<p>После нескольких пауз, прерывавшихся попытками найти другие темы для разговора, Элизабет не смогла удержаться от того, чтобы еще раз не вернуться к мистеру Дарси.</p>
<p>— Меня удивляет, — сказала она, — его близость к мистеру Бингли. Как это мистер Бингли, который кажется мне самим воплощением добропорядочности и, я уверена, обладает превосходным характером, может поддерживать дружбу с подобным человеком? Неужели они могут друг с другом ладить? Кстати, вы знакомы с мистером Бингли?</p>
<p>— Нет, мы друг друга не знаем.</p>
<p>— О, это в самом деле милейший человек. Он и не догадывается о том, что собой представляет мистер Дарси.</p>
<p>— Вполне вероятно. Если мистер Дарси желает, он умеет понравиться. Он не лишен способностей. Когда нужно, он оказывается превосходным собеседником. Вообще среди равных себе он совсем другой, нежели среди тех, кто стоит ниже его на общественной лестнице. Гордость не оставляет его никогда. Но к богатым он более справедлив и снисходителен. С ними он бывает искренен, порядочен и даже, пожалуй, приветлив, отдавая дань их положению и средствам.</p>
<p>Вскоре после этого игра в вист кончилась, и ее участники собрались вокруг другого стола. Мистер Коллинз расположился при этом между своей кузиной Элизабет и ее тетушкой, которая, разумеется, не преминула осведомиться о его карточных успехах. Последние оказались отнюдь не блестящими — он не выиграл ни одной ставки. Однако в ответ на выраженное ею сочувствие он с серьезнейшим видом попросил ее нисколько не огорчаться, ибо он не придает значения деньгам и вполне может пренебречь небольшим проигрышем.</p>
<p>— Мне достаточно известно, сударыня, — сказал он, — что, садясь за карточный стол, человек должен быть готов к подобного рода неудачам. К счастью, мои обстоятельства не таковы, чтобы я должен был много думать о пяти шиллингах. Конечно, есть немало людей, которые не смогли бы сказать то же самое. Но благодаря леди Кэтрин де Бёр я достаточно обеспечен, чтобы не обращать внимания на подобные пустяки.</p>
<p>Слова эти привлекли внимание Уикхема. Взглянув на мистера Коллинза, он вполголоса спросил у Элизабет, насколько ее родственник близко знаком с семейством де Бёр.</p>
<p>— Леди Кэтрин де Бёр, — ответила она, — совсем недавно предоставила ему церковный приход. Мне неизвестно, каким образом она обратила на него свое внимание, но знакомство их не может быть продолжительным.</p>
<p>— Вы, разумеется, знаете, что леди Кэтрин де Бёр и леди Энн Дарси были родными сестрами? Леди Кэтрин приходится теткой мистеру Дарси.</p>
<p>— О нет, я этого не знала. Я вообще не имею понятия о родственных связях леди Кэтрин. До позавчерашнего дня я не догадывалась о ее существовании.</p>
<p>— Ее дочь, мисс де Бёр, получит огромное наследство. Полагают, что она и ее кузен соединят два состояния.</p>
<p>При этих словах Элизабет улыбнулась, невольно вспомнив о бедной мисс Бингли. Тщетными были, оказывается, все ее усилия привлечь внимание мистера Дарси. Тщетными и бесполезными были проявления привязанности к его сестре и восхищение им самим. Мистер Дарси был предназначен для другой.</p>
<p>— Мистер Коллинз, — сказала она, — всячески превозносит леди Кэтрин и ее дочь. Но некоторые странности в его рассказах о своей благодетельнице заставили меня заподозрить, что чувство признательности ввело его в заблуждение. Несмотря на всю благосклонность к моему кузену, ее светлость представляется мне дамой взбалмошной и самодовольной.</p>
<p>— Думаю, что то и другое верно. Я не видел ее уже много лет, но припоминаю, что мне никогда не нравились ее деспотические и вызывающие манеры. Она слывет женщиной необычайно умной и рассудительной. Но я полагаю, что этим она отчасти обязана своему рангу и состоянию, отчасти самоуверенности, а в остальном — гордости племянника, которому хочется, чтобы вся его родня славилась выдающимся умом.</p>
<p>Отзыв этот показался Элизабет вполне убедительным. Молодые люди, очень довольные друг другом, не переставали болтать до тех пор, пока начавшийся ужин не прервал игру, позволив и другим дамам воспользоваться долей внимания мистера Уикхема. За столом миссис Филипс обычно царил такой шум, что разговаривать было почти невозможно. Однако манеры мистера Уикхема понравились всем. Что бы он ни сказал, было сказано хорошо, что бы ни сделал, было сделано с изяществом. Элизабет уехала домой, думая только о нем. Дорогой мысли о мистере Уикхеме и о том, что он ей рассказал, не покидали ее ни на минуту. И все же ей не удалось даже произнести его имени, так как Лидия и мистер Коллинз болтали без умолку. Лидия непрерывно тараторила о своих номерах во время игры в лото, о ставках, которые она проиграла, и ставках, которые выиграла, а мистер Коллинз превозносил любезность мистера и миссис Филипс, убеждал всех, что его совершенно не огорчил карточный проигрыш, перечислял все поданные на стол блюда и беспрестанно осведомлялся, не очень ли он потеснил кузин в экипаже. Круг этих тем был слишком обширен для того, чтобы он успел с ними покончить до остановки кареты перед домом в Лонгборне.</p>
<p></span><span id="id18"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XVII</p>
</div>
<p>На следующий день Элизабет рассказала Джейн о своем разговоре с Уикхемом. Джейн была удивлена и расстроена: она не могла поверить, что мистер Дарси столь недостоин дружбы мистера Бингли. И вместе с тем ей было несвойственно сомневаться в правдивости молодого человека с такой привлекательной внешностью, какой обладал мистер Уикхем. Одной мысли о нанесенном ему ущербе было достаточно, чтобы вызвать ее горячие симпатии. Поэтому ей ничего не оставалось, как попытаться оправдать обоих, приписав все, что могло бросить на них тень, недоразумениям или ошибкам.</p>
<p>— Я думаю, — сказала она, — что оба они были неизвестным нам образом введены в заблуждение. Быть может, какие-то люди, преследуя корыстные цели, создали у них друг о друге ложное представление. Но что именно вызвало между ними разлад, в котором нам лучше не обвинять ни того, ни другого, навсегда останется для нас тайной.</p>
<p>— Ты совершенно права. А теперь, дорогая Джейн, что ты скажешь в защиту тех, кто был в этом деле замешан и преследовал корыстные цели? Не следует ли оправдать также и этих людей? Иначе нам все же придется о ком-то плохо подумать.</p>
<p>— Можешь смеяться надо мной сколько угодно, но переубедить меня тебе не удастся. Лиззи, дорогая, ты только на минуту подумай, какую тень это бросает на мистера Дарси! Так обойтись с любимцем отца, с юношей, жизнь которого его отец обещал обеспечить. Это просто невероятно. Ни один человек, который дорожит своей репутацией, не способен на такой поступок. Разве самые близкие друзья могли бы в нем так обмануться? О нет, это невозможно.</p>
<p>— Мне гораздо легче представить себе, что в нем обманулся мистер Бингли, чем вообразить, что рассказанная вчера история — выдумка мистера Уикхема. Он называл имена, обстоятельства, факты без малейшей запинки. Пусть мистер Дарси попытается, если сможет, все опровергнуть. В его рассказе каждое слово дышало правдой.</p>
<p>— Все это настолько неприятно и запутанно — прямо не знаешь, что и подумать.</p>
<p>— Прости, пожалуйста, но мне-то ясно, что об этом следует думать.</p>
<p>Для Джейн, однако, ясно было только одно — что мистер Бингли, если он и в самом деле был введен в заблуждение, будет глубоко огорчен, когда ему станут известны все обстоятельства.</p>
<p>Этот разговор происходил на обсаженной кустарником дорожке около дома, которую молодым девицам пришлось покинуть из-за приезда некоторых лиц, упоминавшихся в их беседе. Мистер Бингли и его сестры явились в Лонгборн для того, чтобы лично пригласить всех на долгожданный бал в Незерфилде, имевший состояться в ближайший вторник. Обе леди были счастливы снова увидеть свою дорогую подругу, с которой, как им казалось, они не виделись целую вечность. И они наперебой расспрашивали ее, чем она занималась с тех пор, как они расстались. На других Беннетов они почти не обращали внимания, стараясь находиться подальше от хозяйки дома, по возможности не разговаривать с Элизабет и не сказать ни единого слова ее младшим сестрам. Вскоре они поднялись, поразив брата своей поспешностью, и сейчас же уехали. Уходя, они так торопились, как будто им хотелось уклониться от обмена любезностями с миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>Мысли о незерфилдском бале чрезвычайно занимали всех дам в семействе Беннет. Миссис Беннет была склонна считать, что он устраивается в честь ее старшей дочери, и чувствовала себя необыкновенно польщенной тем, что вместо письменного приглашения мистер Бингли лично явился в Лонгборн просить их пожаловать на бал. Джейн рисовала в своем воображении счастливый вечер, который она проведет в обществе двух подруг, принимая знаки внимания со стороны мистера Бингли. Элизабет с удовольствием представляла себе, как она будет танцевать с мистером Уикхемом, находя доказательство всего, что он ей рассказал, в выражении лица и поведении мистера Дарси. Блаженство, которое предвкушали Кэтрин и Лидия, в меньшей степени было связано с какими-нибудь определенными людьми или обстоятельствами. И хотя каждая из них, подобно Элизабет, собиралась половину вечера танцевать с Уикхемом, он ни в коей мере не был для них единственным возможным кавалером — бал должен быть балом при любых обстоятельствах. Даже Мэри уверяла родных, что у нее нет против него возражений.</p>
<p>— С меня достаточно, если я могу располагать своими утренними часами. И я вовсе не считаю, что приношу особенно большую жертву, время от времени принимая участие в вечерних развлечениях. Общество ко всем предъявляет свои права. И я отношусь к тем его членам, которые позволяют себе изредка отвлечься и отдохнуть.</p>
<p>Элизабет была в превосходном настроении. И хотя обычно она старалась разговаривать с мистером Коллинзом как можно меньше, на этот раз она не сдержалась, спросив у него, думает ли он воспользоваться приглашением Бингли и подобает ли его сану участвовать в подобных забавах. Она была немало удивлена, услышав, что ее кузен не испытывал на этот счет ни малейших сомнений и вовсе не опасался упреков со стороны архиепископа или леди Кэтрин де Бёр по поводу своего участия в танцах.</p>
<p>— Позвольте вам заметить, — добавил он, — что бал подобного рода, устроенный вполне достойным молодым человеком для респектабельной публики, не может, по моему мнению, таить в себе зловредных начал. Будучи далек от того, чтобы относиться к танцам с неодобрением, я питаю надежду танцевать в течение вечера с каждой из моих прелестных кузин. И, пользуясь случаем, мисс Элизабет, я имею честь уже сейчас пригласить вас на первый танец, — особая привилегия, которая, как я полагаю, будет правильно понята моей кузиной Джейн и отнюдь не воспринята ею за недостаток уважения с моей стороны.</p>
<p>Элизабет смекнула, что попала впросак. Она была уверена, что на первый танец ее непременно пригласит Уикхем. И что же, — вместо этого ей придется танцевать с Коллинзом! Никогда еще она не проявляла своей общительности так не вовремя. Но делать было уже нечего. Счастливые для нее и для мистера Уикхема минуты должны были, таким образом, наступить несколько позднее. Приглашение мистера Коллинза было принято со всей любезностью, на которую она была способна. Оттого что в его разглагольствованиях проскользнуло нечто большее, чем простая галантность, они не стали приятнее. Ей впервые пришло в голову, что из всех дочерей мистера Беннета именно она может оказаться достойной стать хозяйкой хансфордского прихода, а заодно — и четвертым участником карточной партии в Розингсе при отсутствии более подходящих партнеров. Подозрение это превратилось в уверенность по мере того, как она стала замечать все возраставшие знаки внимания со стороны кузена и его частые комплименты по поводу ее живости и остроумия. Она была скорее встревожена, нежели обрадована действием своих чар, в особенности после того, как миссис Беннет дала ей понять, что весьма приветствует возможность такой партии. Сознавая, какая буря будет вызвана в доме ее отказом, Элизабет предпочла вести себя так, как будто она не понимала намеков. Могло случиться, что мистер Коллинз не соберется сделать предложение. И пока он ни на что не решился, не было смысла поднимать шум по этому поводу.</p>
<p>Без надежды на бал в Незерфилде, к которому нужно было готовиться и о котором можно было вдоволь наговориться, младшие мисс Беннет чувствовали бы себя в это время крайне несчастными. С самого дня приглашения и до того дня, когда бал наконец состоялся, почти непрерывно лил дождь, лишая их возможности добираться до Меритона. Ни тетушки, ни офицеров, ни новостей — даже банты для бальных башмаков были приобретены с помощью посыльного! Испытанию подверглось также терпение Элизабет, ибо плохая погода воздвигла непреодолимое препятствие ее дальнейшему знакомству с мистером Уикхемом. Только ожидание танцев во вторник позволило Китти и Лидии как-то пережить совершенно несносные пятницу, субботу, воскресенье и понедельник.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id19"></span></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XVIII</p>
</div>
<p>До тех пор пока Элизабет не вступила в незерфилдскую гостиную, тщетно выискивая мистера Уикхема среди собравшихся красных мундиров, ей и в голову не приходила мысль, что он может туда не явиться. Встреча с ним казалась ей настолько само собой разумеющейся, что она даже не подумала о некоторых обстоятельствах, которые могли воспрепятствовать его появлению в Незерфилде. Она наряжалась к балу с особой тщательностью и в самом превосходном настроении готовилась к завоеванию всех оставшихся непокоренными уголков его сердца, будучи уверена, что эта задача может быть легко решена в течение одного вечера. Но как только она вошла, у нее зародилось зловещее подозрение, что в угоду своему другу Бингли не включил Уикхема в список приглашенных на бал офицеров. И хотя в действительности дело обстояло не совсем так, отсутствие Уикхема было тут же подтверждено его другом, мистером Денни, на которого с нетерпеливыми расспросами набросилась Лидия. Сообщив, что Уикхему пришлось накануне уехать по делам в Лондон и что он до сих пор не вернулся, Денни с многозначительной улыбкой добавил:</p>
<p>— Не думаю, чтобы дела были способны оторвать его от нас именно в такой день, если бы он не стремился избежать встречи с неким присутствующим здесь джентльменом.</p>
<p>Это замечание едва ли дошло до ушей Лидии, но было понято ее сестрой. Оно доказывало, что Дарси не менее виновен в отсутствии Уикхема, чем если бы подтвердилась ее первоначальная догадка. И, разочарованная во всех своих ожиданиях, Элизабет почувствовала к Дарси такую неприязнь, что с трудом принудила себя вежливо ответить на любезное приветствие, с которым он устремился к ней навстречу. Внимание, сочувствие, снисходительность к этому человеку были равносильны предательству по отношению к Уикхему. Она настолько отвергала всякую возможность беседы с Дарси, что, отвернувшись от него, не смогла преодолеть свой гнев даже в разговоре с мистером Бингли, слепая привязанность которого к своему другу казалась ей непростительной.</p>
<p>Однако Элизабет не была создана для меланхолии. И хотя все ее связанные с балом надежды рухнули, она не могла предаваться мрачным мыслям чересчур долго. Поведав свои огорчения Шарлотте Лукас, с которой они не виделись больше недели, она охотно перешла к рассказу о своем необыкновенном кузене, представив его вниманию своей подруги. Первый танец, однако, снова поверг ее в полное уныние. Это была убийственная церемония. Мистер Коллинз, важный и неуклюжий, делающий все время неверные па и то и дело извиняющийся, вместо того чтобы следить за танцевальными фигурами, заставил ее почувствовать все унижение и досаду, какие только способен вызвать на протяжении одного танца неугодный партнер. Минута, когда она от него наконец отделалась, принесла ей несказанное облегчение.</p>
<p>После Коллинза она танцевала с одним из офицеров. Она несколько пришла в себя, разговорившись с ним об Уикхеме и узнав, что молодой человек пользуется всеобщей симпатией. Оставив своего кавалера, она вернулась к мисс Лукас и, поглощенная беседой, не сразу заметила, что к ней обращается мистер Дарси, приглашая ее на следующий танец. От неожиданности Элизабет растерялась и в замешательстве приняла приглашение. Дарси отошел, и она осталась наедине с подругой, крайне удрученная тем, что не проявила достаточной находчивости. Шарлотта попыталась ее успокоить:</p>
<p>— Думаю все же, что он окажется приятным партнером.</p>
<p>— Упаси боже! Это было бы самым большим несчастьем. Найти приятным человека, которого решилась ненавидеть! Ты не могла пожелать мне ничего худшего.</p>
<p>Когда танцы возобновились и Дарси приблизился к ним, предложив ей свою руку, Шарлотта все же не удержалась и тихонько предостерегла подругу, чтобы она вела себя разумно и из симпатии к Уикхему не уронила себя в глазах несравненно более значительного человека. Элизабет ничего не ответила и заняла место среди танцующих, удивляясь, как это она удостоилась стоять в паре с мистером Дарси, и замечая то же удивление в глазах окружающих. Некоторое время они танцевали молча. Она уже стала думать, что молчание это продлится до конца танца, и хотела сперва ничем его не нарушать. Но, вообразив вдруг, что могла бы досадить партнеру сильнее, если бы заставила его говорить, она произнесла несколько слов по поводу исполнявшейся фигуры. Дарси ответил и замолчал. После паузы, длившейся одну-две минуты, она обратилась к нему опять:</p>
<p>— Теперь, мистер Дарси, ваша очередь поддержать разговор. Я отозвалась о танце — вы могли бы сделать какое-нибудь замечание о величине зала или числе танцующих пар.</p>
<p>Он улыбнулся и выразил готовность сказать все, что она пожелала бы услышать.</p>
<p>— Ну вот и отлично, — ответила она. — На ближайшее время вы сказали вполне достаточно. Быть может, немного погодя я еще замечу, что частные балы гораздо приятнее публичных. Но пока мы вполне можем помолчать.</p>
<p>— А вы привыкли разговаривать, когда танцуете?</p>
<p>— Да, время от времени. Нужно ведь иногда нарушать молчание, не правда ли? Кажется очень нелепым, когда два человека вместе проводят полчаса, не сказав друг другу ни слова. И все же для кого-то будет лучше, если мы поведем разговор таким образом, чтобы сказать друг другу как можно меньше.</p>
<p>— Говоря это, вы предполагали мои желания или подразумевали, что это угодно вам?</p>
<p>— И то и другое, — уклончиво ответила Элизабет. — Я давно замечаю частые совпадения в нашем образе мыслей. Оба мы мало общительны и не склонны к разговору, если только нам не представляется случай сказать что-нибудь из ряда вон выходящее — такое, что может вызвать изумление всех присутствующих и наподобие пословицы из уст в уста передаваться потомству.</p>
<p>— Что касается вашего характера, — сказал он, — вы, по-моему, обрисовали его не вполне точно. Не мне решать, насколько правильно вы охарактеризовали меня. Впрочем, вы сами находите, наверно, этот портрет удачным.</p>
<p>— Не могу судить о собственном искусстве.</p>
<p>Дарси ничего не сказал, и они опять замолчали, пока во время следующей фигуры танца он не спросил у нее, часто ли ее сестрам и ей приходится бывать в Меритоне. Ответив утвердительно, она не удержалась от того, чтобы не добавить:</p>
<p>— Когда мы с вами на днях там встретились, мы только что завели на улице новое знакомство.</p>
<p>Действие этих слов сказалось незамедлительно. На лице Дарси появилось надменное выражение. Но он ничего не сказал, а у Элизабет, как она ни ругала себя за свое малодушие, не хватило решимости пойти дальше. Немного погодя Дарси холодно заметил:</p>
<p>— Мистер Уикхем обладает такими счастливыми манерами и внешностью, что весьма легко <em>приобретает</em> друзей. Достаточно ли он способен их <em>сохранять —</em> вот что кажется мне более сомнительным.</p>
<p>— Он имел несчастье потерять вашу дружбу, — многозначительно заметила Элизабет. — Быть может, это наложит тяжелый отпечаток на всю его жизнь.</p>
<p>Дарси ничего не ответил, но было видно, что ему хотелось переменить тему разговора. В эту минуту рядом с ними очутился Уильям Лукас, пробиравшийся через толпу танцующих на противоположную сторону. Заметив мистера Дарси, он чрезвычайно любезно с ним раскланялся и тут же рассыпался в комплиментах по поводу его манеры танцевать и красоты его дамы.</p>
<p>— Я получил, дорогой сэр, высочайшее удовольствие. Как редко приходится видеть танцующих с таким изяществом. Ваша принадлежность к высшему обществу бросается в глаза. Но разрешите заметить, что прелестная дама, с которой вы сейчас танцуете, кажется мне вполне достойной своего партнера, и я надеюсь получать теперь подобное наслаждение особенно часто. Конечно, после того, как произойдет определенное и, разумеется, столь желанное — не правда ли, дорогая мисс Элиза? — событие! — При этом он посмотрел в сторону Бингли и Джейн. — Сколько оно вызовет поздравлений! Но — я обращаюсь к мистеру Дарси — не позволяйте мне вас задерживать, сэр. Вы не станете благодарить меня за то, что я мешаю вашей беседе с очаровательной молодой леди, сверкающие глазки которой уже начинают посматривать на меня с явным укором.</p>
<p>Последняя часть этой тирады едва ли была услышана Дарси. Но предположение сэра Уильяма относительно его друга сильно на него подействовало. Его лицо приняло очень серьезное выражение, и он пристально посмотрел на танцевавших неподалеку Бингли и Джейн. Придя, однако, в себя, он обернулся к своей даме и сказал:</p>
<p>— Вмешательство сэра Уильяма заставило меня потерять нить нашего разговора.</p>
<p>— По-моему, мы вовсе не разговаривали. Едва ли сэр Уильям мог найти в этом зале двух танцующих, которые хотели бы так мало сказать друг другу. Мы безуспешно пытались коснуться нескольких тем. И мне даже в голову не приходит, о чем бы мы могли поговорить теперь.</p>
<p>— Что вы думаете о книгах? — спросил он с улыбкой.</p>
<p>— О книгах? О нет, я уверена, что мы с вами одних и тех же книг не читали. И, уж во всяком случае, не испытывали при чтении одинаковых чувств.</p>
<p>— Мне жалко, что вы так думаете. Но даже если бы вы были правы, тем легче нам было бы найти тему для разговора. Мы могли бы сопоставить различные мнения.</p>
<p>— Нет, я не в состоянии говорить о книгах во время бала. Здесь мне на ум приходят другие мысли.</p>
<p>— Они всегда относятся к тому, что вас непосредственно окружает, не так ли? — сказал он с сомнением.</p>
<p>— Да, да, всегда, — машинально ответила Элизабет. На самом деле мысли ее блуждали весьма далеко от предмета разговора, что вскоре подтвердилось внезапным замечанием:</p>
<p>— Помнится, мистер Дарси, вы признались, что едва ли простили кого-нибудь в своей жизни. По вашим словам, кто однажды вызвал ваше неудовольствие, не может надеяться на снисхождение. Должно быть, вы достаточно следите за тем, чтобы не рассердиться без всякого повода?</p>
<p>— О да, разумеется, — уверенно ответил Дарси.</p>
<p>— И никогда не становитесь жертвой предубеждения?</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, что нет.</p>
<p>— Для тех, кто не поступается своим мнением, особенно важно судить обо всем здраво с самого начала.</p>
<p>— Могу я узнать, что вы имеете в виду?</p>
<p>— О, я просто пытаюсь разобраться в вашей натуре, — ответила она, стараясь сохранить на лице непринужденное выражение.</p>
<p>— И вам это удается?</p>
<p>Она покачала головой:</p>
<p>— Увы, ни в малейшей степени. Я слышала о вас настолько различные мнения, что попросту теряюсь в догадках.</p>
<p>— Что ж, могу представить себе, что полученные вами сведения весьма противоречивы, — сказал он очень серьезно. — Я бы предпочел, мисс Беннет, чтобы вы пока не рисовали в своем воображении моего духовного облика. В противном случае полученная вами картина не сделает чести ни вам, ни мне.</p>
<p>— Но если я сейчас не подмечу самого главного, быть может, мне никогда не представится другого случая.</p>
<p>— Не хотел бы лишать вас какого бы то ни было удовольствия, — холодно сказал Дарси.</p>
<p>Она ничего не ответила. И закончив танец, они молча разошлись с чувством взаимной неприязни. Впрочем, мистер Дарси уже питал в своем сердце достаточно сильную склонность к Элизабет, благодаря которой он быстро нашел ей оправдание, сосредоточив свой гнев на другом лице.</p>
<p>Вскоре после этого к Элизабет подошла мисс Бингли и обратилась к ней с любезно-высокомерным видом:</p>
<p>— Итак, мисс Элиза, вы в восторге от Джорджа Уикхема, не правда ли? Я слышала об этом от Джейн. Она буквально засыпала меня вопросами о вашем новом приятеле. Однако из ее слов я поняла, что среди прочих своих сообщений молодой человек забыл вам сказать, что он сын старого Уикхема, служившего дворецким у покойного мистера Дарси. Я бы все же хотела дружески вас предостеречь, чтобы вы не очень доверяли его высказываниям. Все, что он говорит о плохом обращении с ним мистера Дарси, — чистейший вымысел. Мистер Дарси, напротив, проявил необыкновенное благородство. Зато Джордж Уикхем поступил по отношению к мистеру Дарси самым непорядочным образом. Я не знакома с подробностями, но хорошо знаю, что мистера Дарси едва ли можно в чем-нибудь упрекнуть. Недаром он даже не переносит упоминания о Джордже Уикхеме! И хотя моему брату казалось невозможным исключить Уикхема из числа приглашенных офицеров, он очень обрадовался, узнав, что тот сам уклонился от приглашения. Появление Уикхема в этих местах — неслыханная дерзость. Непонятно, как он мог на это осмелиться! Мне очень жаль, мисс Элиза, что я должна была разоблачить пороки вашего нового знакомого. Но, пожалуй, учитывая его происхождение, от него едва ли можно было ожидать лучшего.</p>
<p>— Из ваших слов, сударыня, я поняла, что порок мистера Уикхема заключается в его происхождении, — резко ответила Элизабет. — Вы не смогли ничего поставить ему в вину, кроме того, что отец его служил дворецким у мистера Дарси. Но об этом, смею вас заверить, он мне сообщил сам.</p>
<p>— Прошу прощенья, — саркастически заметила, отходя от нее, мисс Бингли. — Извините за вмешательство — я руководствовалась лучшими побуждениями.</p>
<p>«Какая наглость! — произнесла про себя Элизабет. — Но вы, сударыня, глубоко заблуждаетесь, рассчитывая повлиять на меня столь недостойной выходкой. Кроме вашего самодовольного невежества и злокозненности мистера Дарси, вы ничего ею не доказали».</p>
<p>Она тут же разыскала Джейн, которая уже успела поговорить на интересовавшую их тему с мистером Бингли. Сестра встретила ее сияющей улыбкой, свидетельствовавшей о том, сколько радости доставил ей этот вечер. Догадавшись о мыслях Джейн по выражению лица, Элизабет поняла, что все ее сочувствие неудачам мистера Уикхема, негодование против его врагов и прочее значат очень немного по сравнению с надеждой на грядущее счастье сестры.</p>
<p>— Мне, конечно, хотелось бы узнать, — сказала она с не менее приветливой улыбкой, — удалось ли тебе что-нибудь выяснить о мистере Уикхеме. Но, быть может, ты провела время так приятно, что могла думать лишь об одном человеке? Я на тебя не обижусь.</p>
<p>— Я вовсе про него не забыла, Лиззи, — ответила Джейн. — Но, увы, не могу сказать тебе ничего утешительного. Мистеру Бингли эта история мало знакома. В чем именно мистер Уикхем виноват перед мистером Дарси, он не знает. Но он готов поручиться за добропорядочность, честность и благородство своего друга. И он убежден, что мистер Уикхем не заслуживал даже той заботы, которую проявил по отношению к нему мистер Дарси. Меня это огорчает, но из его слов, так же как из слов мисс Бингли, следует, что мистера Уикхема нельзя считать порядочным человеком. Боюсь, он вел себя слишком неосмотрительно и тем самым лишился уважения мистера Дарси вполне заслуженно.</p>
<p>— А мистер Бингли знаком с мистером Уикхемом?</p>
<p>— Нет, он его ни разу не видел до встречи в Меритоне.</p>
<p>— В таком случае его взгляды на Уикхема заимствованы у мистера Дарси? Что ж, я вполне удовлетворена. Ну-с, а какие у него сведения о церковном приходе?</p>
<p>— Он не припоминает в точности обстоятельств, хотя не раз слышал о них от своего друга. Приход, кажется, был оставлен за Уикхемом только условно.</p>
<p>— Я не сомневаюсь в искренности мистера Бингли, — сказала Элизабет как можно мягче. — Но извини меня, если я не удовлетворюсь общими фразами. Мистер Бингли, конечно, должен добросовестно защищать интересы своего друга. Но так как некоторые части этой истории ему неизвестны, а с остальными он знаком только со слов самого мистера Дарси, я позволю себе относиться к обоим молодым людям по-прежнему.</p>
<p>После этого она перевела разговор на гораздо более приятную тему, которая не вызывала между ними никаких расхождений. С радостью услышала она от Джейн, сколько счастливых и вместе с тем робких надежд вызывает в ней ухаживание мистера Бингли. И Элизабет высказала все, что было возможно, чтобы поддержать в ней эти надежды. Когда к сестрам присоединился мистер Бингли, Элизабет отошла в сторону и отыскала мисс Лукас. Она едва успела ответить на вопрос подруги о том, понравился ли ей последний партнер по танцам, как к ним подошел мистер Коллинз и в крайнем возбуждении сообщил, что он имел удовольствие только что сделать важнейшее открытие.</p>
<p>— Благодаря чистейшей случайности, — сказал он, — я обнаружил в этой комнате близкого родственника моей патронессы. Мне посчастливилось услышать, как он в разговоре с молодой леди, являющейся украшением этого дома, упомянул имена его кузины мисс де Бёр и ее матери леди Кэтрин. Случаются же на свете подобные чудеса! Кто бы мог подумать, что здесь, на этом балу, я встречусь чуть ли не с племянником леди Кэтрин? Я благодарю небо за то, что у меня вовремя раскрылись глаза и я могу засвидетельствовать ему мое почтение! Конечно, я не премину совершить это сию же минуту. И я уповаю на то, что он простит мне медлительность, которая оправдывается лишь моей неосведомленностью.</p>
<p>— Не собираетесь ли вы представиться мистеру Дарси?</p>
<p>— О разумеется. Я буду покорнейше просить у него прощения за то, что не сделал этого раньше. Думаю, что он в самом деле приходится племянником леди Кэтрин. И я буду в состоянии заверить его, что всего неделю тому назад здоровье ее светлости не оставляло желать лучшего.</p>
<p>Элизабет попыталась по возможности удержать мистера Коллинза от этого шага. Она доказывала, что Дарси сочтет обращение к нему незнакомого человека скорее непозволительной вольностью, нежели данью уважения к своей тетке, что здесь они вполне могут не обращать друг на друга внимания и, наконец, что если бы даже в этом и возникла необходимость, то первый шаг к знакомству должен был сделать мистер Дарси, занимающий более высокое положение в обществе. Мистер Коллинз выслушал ее с видом человека, твердо решившего поступить по-своему, и, когда она замолчала, ответил:</p>
<p>— Дорогая моя мисс Элизабет! Я питаю самое высокое мнение относительно вашей превосходной способности судить о вещах, в которых вы хорошо разбираетесь. Но позвольте мне сказать, что имеется глубокое различие между нормами человеческих отношений, принятыми среди мирян, и теми, которые определяют поведение священнослужителей. Я должен присовокупить к этому, что ставлю служение церкви, в смысле почетности, вровень с исполнением самых высоких обязанностей в королевстве, — конечно, если только не забывать, что это служение должно осуществляться с подобающим смирением. А потому разрешите мне следовать в данном случае голосу совести, который призывает меня совершить то, что я нахожу своим долгом. Простите меня за нежелание воспользоваться вашим советом, которым я готов руководствоваться в любом другом деле. Но при сложившихся обстоятельствах я полагаю себя по образованию и опыту более способным судить о правильности своего поведения, нежели подобная вам юная леди.</p>
<p>Отвесив глубокий поклон, мистер Коллинз покинул Элизабет и направился прямо к мистеру Дарси. С тревогой стала она наблюдать, какое действие произведет на Дарси это неожиданное обращение. При первых же словах кузена Дарси явно удивился. Мистер Коллинз начал с торжественного расшаркивания, и, хотя речь его до нее не долетала, ей казалось, что она слышит фразу за фразой, по мере того как по движению его губ разгадывала произносимые им слова: «извинения», «Хансфорд» и «леди Кэтрин де Бёр». Ей было крайне досадно видеть, что ее родственник выступает перед мистером Дарси в столь комической роли. Последний смотрел на Коллинза с нескрываемым изумлением и, когда тот наконец позволил Дарси заговорить, ответил ему очень холодно. Это, однако, нисколько не обескуражило мистера Коллинза и не удержало его от новой тирады, продолжительность которой, казалось, еще больше увеличила презрение к нему мистера Дарси, так что, когда она закончилась, он только слегка кивнул головой и пошел прочь, в то время как Коллинз возвратился к Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Поверьте, я ни в коей мере не разочарован оказанным мне приемом, — сказал он, подойдя. — Мистер Дарси весьма доволен моей почтительностью. Он разговаривал со мной необыкновенно любезно и даже отплатил мне комплиментом, сказав, что достаточно знает разборчивость леди Кэтрин и не сомневается, что ее благосклонностью могут пользоваться только истинно достойные люди. Как это прекрасно сказано! Право, мне он очень понравился.</p>
<p>Так как самой Элизабет уже нечего было ждать от бала, она почти все внимание сосредоточила на сестре и мистере Бингли. Это навело ее на приятнейшие мысли, от которых она почувствовала себя почти такой же счастливой, как Джейн. В своем воображении она уже видела сестру хозяйкой этого дома, живущей в довольстве и счастье, которое может возникнуть только в браке, основанном на настоящей любви. При таких обстоятельствах она считала себя даже способной полюбить сестер мистера Бингли. Было очевидно, что мысли миссис Беннет сосредоточены на том же, и Элизабет твердо решила держаться от нее поодаль, боясь, как бы мать не сказала ей чего-нибудь лишнего. Однако, усаживаясь за стол, Элизабет, к своему огорчению, оказалась почти рядом с миссис Беннет. С досадой услышала она, что непрекращающийся громкий разговор матери с самым неподходящим человеком — леди Лукас — посвящен не чему иному, как предстоящей женитьбе мистера Бингли на Джейн. Тема была настолько увлекательной, что в своем перечислении преимуществ будущей партии миссис Беннет была совершенно неутомима. Прежде всего она поздравляла себя с тем, что Бингли такой милый молодой человек, что он так богат и живет всего в трех милях от Лонгборна. Далее она с восторгом говорила о том, как привязались к Джейн сестры мистера Бингли и как они должны радоваться возможности взаимно породниться. Более того, как много хорошего это событие сулит ее младшим дочерям, которые после замужества Джейн окажутся на виду у других богатых мужчин. И, наконец, как будет удобно ей, в ее возрасте, оставлять своих незамужних дочерей на попечение замужней сестры и появляться в обществе, только когда ей заблагорассудится — обстоятельство, которое, в соответствии с общепринятыми взглядами, следовало непременно выдавать за приятное, хотя трудно было найти человека, менее охотно сидящего дома, чем миссис Беннет. В заключение выражалось множество пожеланий, чтобы леди Лукас оказалась столь же счастлива в ближайшем будущем, хотя всем своим видом миссис Беннет отчетливо и с торжеством давала понять, что считает это совершенно невероятным.</p>
<p>Тщетно дочка пыталась унять поток материнского красноречия или хотя бы упросить мать, чтобы она выражала свои восторги не таким громким шепотом, ибо он, как замечала к своей невыразимой досаде Элизабет, почти полностью доходил до ушей сидевшего напротив мистера Дарси. Мать только сердилась на нее, говоря, что она несет чепуху.</p>
<p>— Кто такой для меня твой мистер Дарси, чтобы мне его бояться? Разве мы у него в долгу за любезное обращение, чтобы стараться не сказать ему чего-нибудь не по вкусу?</p>
<p>— Мама, ради бога, попытайтесь говорить тише. Для чего оскорблять мистера Дарси? Разве вы этим хорошо зарекомендуете себя перед его другом?</p>
<p>Уговоры, однако, не производили на мать никакого действия. Миссис Беннет продолжала во всеуслышание разглагольствовать о питаемых ею надеждах, и Элизабет то и дело приходилось краснеть от стыда и досады. Ей было трудно удерживаться от того, чтобы время от времени не бросать взгляд на Дарси, каждый раз убеждаясь, насколько основательны ее опасения. Хотя Дарси и не всегда смотрел в сторону миссис Беннет, она была убеждена, что его внимание сосредоточено именно на ней. При этом выражение его лица постепенно менялось: если вначале на нем было написано негодующее презрение, то под конец оно было исполнено мрачной и неуклонной решимости.</p>
<p>В конце концов, однако, красноречие миссис Беннет иссякло, и леди Лукас, которая во время этих, едва ли разделяемых ею, восторженных излияний неоднократно подавляла зевки, получила наконец возможность спокойно сосредоточиться на курице и ветчине. Элизабет начала было уже приходить в себя. Однако передышка оказалась короткой. Когда ужин окончился, заговорили о музыке, и ей пришлось перенести еще одно унижение, увидев, как Мэри после недолгих уговоров приготовилась ублажать публику своим искусством. Элизабет попыталась взглядом предотвратить такую самоотверженность с ее стороны, но тщетно. Обрадовавшись возможности показать себя во всем блеске, Мэри не хотела ничего понимать и тут же уселась за фортепьяно. С крайней досадой Элизабет, не отрывая глаз, наблюдала за сестрой и нетерпеливо следила, как та переходит от куплета к куплету. Окончание песни, впрочем, не принесло облегчения — уловив среди одобрительных возгласов намек на просьбу продлить доставленное удовольствие, сестра тотчас же принялась за новую. Мэри не обладала никакими данными для выступлений перед публикой: голос у нее был слабый, манера исполнения — вымученная. Элизабет была в отчаянии. Она посмотрела на старшую сестру, чтобы узнать, как эту же муку переживает Джейн. Но Джейн очень мило болтала с Бингли. Элизабет взглянула на его сестер и увидела, что они делают насмешливые знаки друг другу и мистеру Дарси, который, однако, сохранял непроницаемо мрачное выражение. Наконец она бросила взгляд на отца, умоляя его вмешаться, так как иначе Мэри могла бы продолжать свое пение до утра. Он понял ее и, когда Мэри закончила вторую песню, громко сказал:</p>
<p>— Этого вполне хватит, дитя мое. Ты уже достаточно долго услаждала наш слух. Позволь теперь и другим молодым девицам себя показать.</p>
<p>Хотя Мэри и сделала вид, что его слова до нее не дошли, она все же была ими несколько сконфужена. А Элизабет, переживая обиду за сестру и досадуя на отца, чувствовала, что своим вмешательством только ухудшила дело. Между тем стали искать нового исполнителя.</p>
<p>— Если бы мне, — произнес мистер Коллинз, — посчастливилось обладать музыкальными способностями, я, несомненно, счел бы для себя удовольствием порадовать общество какой-нибудь арией. Ибо я нахожу музыку самым невинным развлечением, вполне совместимым с положением служителя церкви. Разумеется, я не считаю, что мы вправе уделять музыке слишком много времени — существует столько дел, требующих от нас внимания. Если бы вы знали, сколько обязанностей у пастыря церковного прихода! Во-первых, ему нужно распределить десятину, заботясь при этом о своих интересах и не нарушая в то же время интересов своего патрона. Далее, ему необходимо сочинять проповеди. Остального времени едва хватает на исполнение церковных обрядов и заботу об усовершенствовании своего жилища, комфортом которого он ни в коем случае не вправе пренебрегать. Столь же важно для него проявлять внимание и участие ко всем окружающим и в особенности к тем из них, кому он обязан своим положением. И я отнюдь не освобождаю себя от подобного долга, так же, как не стал бы хорошо думать о человеке, который упускает возможность выразить почтение любой особе, находящейся в родственных отношениях с его патроном!</p>
<p>И он заключил свою речь, произнесенную таким громким голосом, что ее услышала половина собравшегося общества, поклоном в сторону мистера Дарси. Кое-кто из присутствующих пристально посмотрел на мистера Коллинза, кое-кто улыбнулся. Но никого его речь не позабавила больше, чем мистера Беннета, в то время как миссис Беннет вполне серьезно ее одобрила, поведав тихим голосом своей соседке леди Лукас, что мистер Коллинз необыкновенно умный и достойный молодой человек.</p>
<p>Элизабет казалось, что, если бы все члены ее семейства нарочно сговорились выставить в этот вечер напоказ свои недостатки, им едва ли удалось бы выполнить это с большим блеском и добиться более значительного успеха. К счастью для мистера Бингли и Джейн, некоторые номера этого спектакля, по-видимому, ускользнули от внимания молодого человека, не слишком чувствительного к проявлениям человеческой глупости. Однако достаточным злом было уже и то, что для его сестер и мистера Дарси открывалась великолепная возможность высмеивать ее родню. И Элизабет не могла решить, что для нее было более невыносимо: вызывающие улыбки двух леди или молчаливое презрение джентльмена.</p>
<p>Остаток вечера принес ей мало приятного. Ее продолжал мучить мистер Коллинз, неотлучно следовавший за ней по пятам. Не будучи в состоянии уговорить ее танцевать, он своим присутствием лишал ее возможности принять приглашение какого-нибудь другого кавалера. Тщетно уговаривала она его воспользоваться обществом других барышень, предлагая познакомить его с любой из присутствовавших на балу. Мистер Коллинз утверждал, что он равнодушен к танцам и что больше всего ему бы хотелось выразить свое внимание дорогой кузине, надеясь тем самым как можно лучше зарекомендовать себя в ее глазах. По этой причине он предпочел бы до конца бала с ней не разлучаться. Против такого желания было трудно что-нибудь возразить. Поэтому Элизабет была благодарна мисс Лукас за то, что она часто к ним подходила и самоотверженно принимала на себя труд поддерживать разговор с мистером Коллинзом.</p>
<p>Элизабет, по крайней мере, была рада избавиться от знаков внимания со стороны мистера Дарси, который, хотя нередко и прохаживался без всякого дела неподалеку от нее, больше уже не пытался с ней заговаривать. Было приятно предположить, что она добилась этого намеками на мистера Уикхема.</p>
<p>Гости из Лонгборна покинули зал последними. Благодаря особой уловке миссис Беннет их экипаж был подан спустя четверть часа после того, как все остальные приглашенные уже уехали. Это дало им возможность заметить, с каким нетерпением ждал их отъезда кое-кто из обитателей Незерфилда. Миссис Хёрст и ее сестра открывали рот лишь для того, чтобы посетовать на свою усталость, всем видом показывая, насколько им хочется наконец остаться одним. Уклоняясь от попыток миссис Беннет завязать разговор, они наводили оцепенение на всех присутствующих. Сцена эта слабо оживлялась пространными рассуждениями мистера Коллинза, полными комплиментов по адресу мистера Бингли и его сестер, по поводу изысканности только что закончившегося вечера и любезности и гостеприимства хозяев дома. Мистер Дарси вообще ничего не говорил. Мистер Беннет также молчал, смакуя развернувшееся перед ним зрелище. Мистер Бингли и Джейн, стоя несколько поодаль от других, разговаривали только между собой. Элизабет хранила молчание не менее упорно, чем миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли. И даже Лидия была настолько утомлена, что не произнесла ни слова, если не считать отрывочных восклицаний вроде: «Боже, как я устала!» — сопровождавшихся энергичным зевком.</p>
<p>Когда все наконец направились к выходу, миссис Беннет любезнейшим образом выразила непременное желание вскоре увидеть незерфилдскую компанию в Лонгборне. Обращаясь главным образом к мистеру Бингли, она сказала, что ее семья будет счастлива в любое время разделить с ним и его близкими скромный обед — без церемоний и формальных приглашений. Мистер Бингли искренне ее поблагодарил и охотно обещал навестить их при первом удобном случае после возвращения из короткой деловой поездки в Лондон, куда он должен был выехать на следующее утро.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет была вполне удовлетворена. Покидая Незерфилд, она питала счастливую уверенность, что ее дочь переедет сюда спустя три-четыре месяца, которые понадобятся для приобретения новых экипажей и обстановки и приготовления свадебных нарядов. В той же мере она была убеждена в скором замужестве и второй дочери. Надежда на этот брак также доставляла ей немалое удовольствие, хотя и не столь сильное, как предвкушение замужества Джейн. Миссис Беннет любила Элизабет меньше других дочерей. И хотя она ничего не имела против Коллинза и его пасторского домика, они, конечно, не шли ни в какое сравнение с мистером Бингли и Незерфилдом.</p>

<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XIX</p>
</div>
<p>На следующее утро в Лонгборне произошли новые важные события. Мистер Коллинз сделал формальное предложение второй дочери мистера Беннета. Срок его пребывания в Лонгборне истекал в ближайшую субботу, и он решил не терять времени. Он не отличался застенчивостью, которая помешала бы ему свободно выразить свои чувства, а потому осуществил это намерение весьма продуманно, сопровождая свои действия всеми подобающими условностями.</p>
<p>Застав миссис Беннет после завтрака в обществе Элизабет и одной из ее младших сестер, он обратился к хозяйке дома со следующим вопросом:</p>
<p>— Могу ли я надеяться, сударыня, что вы употребите ваше влияние на прелестную мисс Элизабет, если я попрошу ее оказать мне сегодня особую честь, позволив побеседовать с ней наедине?</p>
<p>Элизабет успела только покраснеть от неожиданности, ибо миссис Беннет сейчас же воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Ах, боже мой! Ну конечно! Само собой разумеется! Я уверена, что Лиззи выслушает вас с большим удовольствием. У нее не может быть никаких возражений. Пойдем, Китти, ты мне понадобишься наверху.</p>
<p>И, собрав свое шитье, она заторопилась к выходу. Элизабет попробовала ее остановить:</p>
<p>— Пожалуйста, не уходите отсюда. Я вас очень прошу. Мистер Коллинз меня извинит. Он не скажет мне ничего, что не мог бы услышать в этом доме любой человек. Я лучше уйду сама.</p>
<p>— Какие глупости. Мне нужно, чтобы ты осталась в этой комнате. — И, увидев, что смутившаяся и растерявшаяся Элизабет может и в самом деле сбежать, добавила: — Лиззи, я требую, чтобы ты осталась и выслушала мистера Коллинза.</p>
<p>У Элизабет не хватило духу нарушить столь безоговорочный приказ. И так как короткое размышление подсказало ей, что умнее всего будет покончить с делом возможно быстрее и с наименьшим шумом, она снова присела и углубилась в шитье. Ей хотелось смеяться и плакать. И как только миссис Беннет и Китти вышли, Коллинз приступил к объяснению.</p>
<p>— Поверьте, дорогая мисс Элизабет, ваша скромность не только не роняет вас в моих глазах, но даже еще сильнее подчеркивает ваше совершенство. Вы не казались бы мне столь очаровательной, если бы не обнаружили некоторого нежелания пойти мне навстречу. Позвольте, однако, вас заверить, что, обращаясь к вам, я уже заручился согласием вашей почтенной матушки. Вы едва ли заблуждаетесь в отношении преследуемых мною целей, хотя, быть может, и станете это отрицать ввиду вашей природной застенчивости. В самом деле, я слишком явно оказывал вам свое предпочтение, чтобы вы могли не понять моих намерений. Почти в ту самую минуту, как я переступил порог этого дома, я понял, что вам суждено стать спутницей моей жизни. Но, прежде чем дать волю моим пламенным чувствам, быть может, мне следовало бы поделиться с вами мотивами, по которым я собираюсь жениться и которые заставили меня приехать в Хартфордшир, чтобы найти в этом доме свою будущую подругу?</p>
<p>Мысль, что ее рассудительный и напыщенный кузен может дать волю своим пламенным чувствам, чуть не заставила Элизабет рассмеяться. Из-за этого она не смогла воспользоваться небольшой паузой и удержать мистера Коллинза от дальнейших излияний, позволив ему продолжить свой монолог.</p>
<p>— Итак, я собираюсь жениться, считая, во-первых, что всякий служитель церкви, не стесненный, подобно мне, в средствах, должен быть примерным семьянином в своем приходе. Во-вторых, я уверен, что этот шаг сделает мою жизнь еще более счастливой. И, наконец, в-третьих, — хотя, быть может, мне следовало упомянуть об этом прежде всего, — я особо руководствуюсь в данном случае советом и пожеланиями весьма благородной леди, которую имею честь называть своей патронессой. Она уже дважды снизошла до того, чтобы высказать (без всякой просьбы с моей стороны!) свои взгляды по этому поводу. И даже в субботу, накануне моего отъезда из Хансфорда, когда миссис Дженкинсон, в перерыве между двумя партиями кадрили, поправляла скамеечку в ногах мисс де Бёр, леди Кэтрин сказала мне: «Мистер Коллинз, вам следует жениться. Служитель церкви вашего склада должен быть женатым человеком. Выбирайте разумно, выбирайте достойную. Учтите мой вкус, считаясь, конечно, и со своим. Пусть это будет порядочная и работящая женщина, не избалованная, такая, которая способна сводить концы с концами при скромном доходе. Я вам это советую. Найдите себе возможно скорее подходящую жену, привезите ее в Хансфорд, и я нанесу ей визит». Я бы хотел, кстати, заметить, моя прелестная кузина, что отнюдь не ставлю внимание и доброту леди Кэтрин де Бёр на последнее место в ряду тех преимуществ, которые я в состоянии предложить вместе с моей рукой. Познакомившись с леди Кэтрин, вы поймете, что я не мог описать вам ее манеры так, как они того заслуживают. И я надеюсь, что ей понравятся свойственные вам живость и остроумие, которые, разумеется, будут должным образом смягчены сдержанностью и уважением, внушаемыми ее высоким рангом. Вот к чему сводятся общие соображения, которые побуждают меня к женитьбе. Мне остается только сказать — почему я обратил свои взоры именно в сторону Лонгборна, а не окружающих Хансфорд селений, в которых, смею вас уверить, имеется немало приятных молодых леди. Суть дела в том, что после смерти вашего высокочтимого батюшки (да проживет он еще многие лета!) мне предстоит унаследовать его имение. И дабы успокоить в этом отношении мою щепетильность, я решил сделать своей женой одну из его дочерей. Я бы хотел, чтобы они как можно меньше почувствовали потерю тогда, когда произойдет, увы, столь печальное событие, которое, однако, как я уже говорил, может совершиться еще очень не скоро. Таковы были мои побуждения, прелестная кузина, и я льщу себя надеждой, что они не уронят меня в ваших глазах. Мне остается только уверить вас самым пламенным образом в необыкновенной силе моей привязанности. Я вполне равнодушен к деньгам и не собираюсь предъявлять никаких претензий по этому поводу вашему батюшке, ибо достаточно знаю, сколь мало они могут быть удовлетворены. Я также осведомлен, что одна тысяча фунтов из четырех процентов годовых, и то переходящая к вам только после кончины миссис Беннет, — все, чем вы можете располагать в будущем. По этому поводу я буду нем как рыба, и вы можете быть уверены, что ни один неблаговидный упрек вовеки не сорвется с моих уст.</p>
<p>Было необходимо остановить его как можно скорее.</p>
<p>— Вы торопитесь, сэр! — вскричала Элизабет. — Вы забыли, что я еще ничего не ответила. Разрешите мне это сделать без промедления. Примите, сэр, благодарность за оказанную мне честь. Я глубоко сознаю, поверьте, сколь лестно для меня ваше предложение, но я вынуждена его отклонить.</p>
<p>— О, мне приходилось слышать, — перебил ее мистер Коллинз с выразительным жестом, — что молодые леди, когда мужчина впервые просит их составить его счастье, нередко отклоняют предложение, которое в глубине души готовы принять. В некоторых случаях отказ повторяют во второй и даже в третий раз. Поэтому меня ничуть не обескураживают ваши слова, и я искренне надеюсь, что в недалеком будущем поведу вас к алтарю.</p>
<p>— Однако после моего ответа, сэр, — воскликнула Элизабет, — ваша надежда не кажется обоснованной. Уверяю вас, я не отношусь к числу молодых женщин (если они вообще существуют), у которых хватает смелости рисковать своим счастьем, рассчитывая на повторное предложение. Я ответила вам вполне серьезно. Вы не можете сделать счастливой меня, и, по моему глубокому убеждению, из всех женщин на свете я меньше всех могла бы составить счастье такого человека, как вы. Не сомневаюсь, если бы меня узнала ваш друг леди Кэтрин, она ни в коем случае не одобрила бы ваш выбор.</p>
<p>— Неужели леди Кэтрин в самом деле так бы к вам отнеслась? — проговорил мистер Коллинз с серьезной миной. — Но я не могу себе представить, чтобы вы не понравились ее светлости. Можете быть уверены, когда я буду иметь честь с ней встретиться, я опишу вашу скромность, хозяйственность и прочие положительные качества в самом выгодном свете.</p>
<p>— Увы, мистер Коллинз, похвалы по моему адресу будут напрасными. Позвольте мне самой решить мою судьбу и соблаговолите поверить моим словам. Я от души желаю вам богатства и счастья и, отказываясь выйти за вас замуж, делаю все, что только зависит от меня, чтобы эти пожелания сбылись. Предложив мне руку, вы должны были успокоить свою щепетильность в отношении нашей семьи. И теперь вы сможете вступить во владение Лонгборнским имением, когда оно к вам перейдет, без угрызений совести. Таким образом, вопрос этот можно считать вполне решенным.</p>
<p>С этими словами она уже было хотела покинуть комнату, но мистер Коллинз заговорил опять:</p>
<p>— Когда я буду иметь честь беседовать с вами на ту же тему еще раз, я буду надеяться получить более благоприятный ответ, чем тот, который вы мне дали сейчас. Вместе с тем я далек от того, чтобы обвинить вас в бесчувственности, хорошо зная, насколько свойственно вашему полу отвечать отказом мужчине, когда он делает предложение в первый раз. Быть может, вы даже обнадежили меня в той мере, какую допускает истинная деликатность женской души.</p>
<p>— Вы меня в самом деле обескураживаете, мистер Коллинз, — с некоторым волнением проговорила Элизабет. — Если мой ответ показался вам обнадеживающим, я не представляю себе, как мне выразить свой отказ, чтобы он стал для вас убедительным.</p>
<p>— Позвольте мне, кузина, утешиться мыслью, что вы отклонили мое предложение лишь на словах. Коротко говоря, я убежден в этом по следующим причинам. Мне вовсе не кажется, что я недостоин вашей руки или что условия жизни, которые я в состоянии вам предложить, могут вас не устраивать. Мне особо благоприятствует мое положение в обществе, связи с семьей де Бёр и родство с вашим семейством. И, несмотря на все ваши достоинства, вы должны понимать, что вам может не представиться нового случая выйти замуж. Незначительность вашего приданого может ослабить всю притягательную силу вашей красоты и прочих положительных качеств. Поэтому я считаю, что в глубине души вы вовсе не намерены мне отказать. И я склонен объяснить ваш ответ желанием сильнее воспламенить мои чувства посредством очаровательного кокетства, свойственного хорошеньким женщинам.</p>
<p>— Уверяю вас, сэр, я совершенно не претендую на успех, которого можно добиться игрой на чувствах серьезного человека. Мне больше хотелось бы, чтобы вы оценили мою искренность. Я еще раз благодарю вас за честь, оказанную мне вашим любезным предложением, но принять его для меня решительно невозможно. Все мои чувства восстают против этого. Могу ли я выразиться яснее? Перестаньте же смотреть на меня, как на завлекающую вас в сети кокетку, и постарайтесь увидеть перед собой разумное существо, говорящее правду от всего сердца!</p>
<p>— Вы просто прелесть! — воскликнул он, проявляя несвоевременную галантность. — И я убежден, что, когда мое предложение будет одобрено вашими высокочтимыми родителями, вы отнесетесь к нему вполне благожелательно.</p>
<p>Элизабет поняла, что совершенно бессильна сколько-нибудь поколебать самоуверенность мистера Коллинза. И она тут же вышла из комнаты, решив, если он и дальше будет принимать ее отказ за обнадеживающие поощрения, обратиться к отцу, который сможет ему ответить достаточно определенно, не опасаясь, что его поведение будет истолковано как кокетство хорошенькой женщины.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА XX</p>
</div>
<p>Мистеру Коллинзу не пришлось долго предаваться размышлениям о своих любовных успехах. Исхода переговоров нетерпеливо ожидала в прихожей миссис Беннет. И как только ее дочь, распахнув дверь, пробежала мимо нее, она устремилась к Коллинзу, горячо поздравляя его и себя по поводу того, что между ними в скором времени установится самое близкое родство. Мистер Коллинз выслушал это пылкое обращение и ответил на него столь же восторженно, а затем пересказал ей подробности состоявшегося объяснения, результатами которого он, как ему казалось, мог быть вполне удовлетворен. В самом деле, упорный отказ его кузины естественно объяснялся ее застенчивостью и деликатностью ее натуры.</p>
<p>У миссис Беннет это сообщение вызвало все же некоторую тревогу. Ей хотелось бы надеяться, что Элизабет отвергла сватовство мистера Коллинза с намерением еще больше воспламенить его чувства. Однако она не смела этому верить и не могла скрыть своих опасений от собеседника.</p>
<p>— Но положитесь, мой дорогой, на меня! — сказала она. — Уж я-то сумею ее образумить. Сию же минуту поговорю с ней начистоту. Экая упрямая и своенравная девчонка — сама не понимает своего счастья. Но она у меня <em>научится</em> его понимать.</p>
<p>— Простите, сударыня, что я позволю себе вас перебить, — заметил мистер Коллинз. — Но если она в самом деле упряма и своенравна, я не уверен, что она вообще способна стать подходящей супругой человека моего положения, который, естественно, ищет в брачном союзе благополучия. Поэтому если она будет и дальше отказываться принять мое предложение, нам, быть может, лучше не принуждать ее к этому? Боюсь, что, страдая подобными недостатками, она едва ли сможет сделать меня счастливым.</p>
<p>— Ах, сэр, вы меня поняли совершенно превратно, — ответила встревоженная миссис Беннет. — Лиззи бывает упряма только в подобных исключительных случаях. При всех других обстоятельствах — это самое покладистое существо на земле. Я сейчас переговорю с мистером Беннетом и ручаюсь вам — очень скоро мы все уладим.</p>
<p>Не давая ему времени для ответа, она опрометью бросилась к мужу, заговорив прямо с порога библиотеки:</p>
<p>— О, мистер Беннет, вы должны немедленно мне помочь! Все мы в полном смятении. Бегите и заставьте Лиззи выйти замуж за мистера Коллинза, так как она не согласна стать его женой. И если вы не вмешаетесь в это сию же минуту, он может раздумать и не пожелает стать ее мужем.</p>
<p>При ее появлении мистер Беннет оторвался от книги и невозмутимо посмотрел на супругу, ничем не показывая, что он сколько-нибудь встревожен ее сообщением.</p>
<p>— К сожалению, моя дорогая, я не имел удовольствия уразуметь смысл ваших слов, — сказал он, когда она замолчала. — О чем вы толкуете?</p>
<p>— О мистере Коллинзе и Лиззи. Лиззи заявила, что она не хочет выходить замуж за мистера Коллинза, а мистер Коллинз уже начал говорить, что он не женится на Лиззи.</p>
<p>— И что же при таких обстоятельствах я могу предпринять? Дело выглядит достаточно безнадежным.</p>
<p>— О, вы должны поговорить с Лиззи! Потребуйте от нее, чтобы она вышла за него замуж.</p>
<p>— Пусть ее позовут сюда. Я выскажу ей свое мнение.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет позвонила, и мисс Элизабет была приглашена в библиотеку.</p>
<p>— Подойди ко мне, дитя мое, — произнес отец, когда она вошла. — Я послал за тобой ради важного дела. Насколько я понимаю, мистер Коллинз предложил тебе выйти за него замуж. Верно ли это?</p>
<p>Элизабет ответила утвердительно.</p>
<p>— Очень хорошо. И ты ему отказала?</p>
<p>— Да, сэр.</p>
<p>— Прекрасно. Теперь мы подходим к самому главному. Твоя мать требует, чтобы ты приняла его предложение, — не правда ли, миссис Беннет?</p>
<p>— О да. Иначе я больше не хочу ее видеть.</p>
<p>— Итак, моя дочь, ты поставлена перед трагическим выбором. С этой минуты ты лишаешься одного из родителей. Твоя мать не желает видеть тебя, если ты не пойдешь за мистера Коллинза, а я больше никогда на тебя не взгляну, если ты вздумаешь с его предложением согласиться.</p>
<p>Элизабет не могла удержаться от улыбки при подобном завершении разговора, начатого столь торжественно. Но миссис Беннет, которая внушила себе, что ее муж смотрит на дело так же, как и она, была крайне обескуражена.</p>
<p>— Что вы имеете в виду, мистер Беннет, рассуждая подобным образом? Разве вы не обещали мне заставить эту девчонку выйти за него замуж?</p>
<p>— Дорогая моя, — ответил ее супруг, — у меня к вам две небольшие просьбы. Во-первых, я бы хотел, чтобы вы мне разрешили свободно располагать в данном случае собственным здравым смыслом, а во-вторых — собственной комнатой. Мне было бы очень приятно, если бы библиотека как можно скорее оказалась в моем распоряжении.</p>
<p>Несмотря на то, что миссис Беннет была разочарована своим мужем, она все же не собиралась сдаваться. Снова и снова она заговаривала с Элизабет, то и дело переходя от увещеваний к угрозам. Мать попробовала было найти поддержку у Джейн, но Джейн, с присущей ей мягкостью, отказалась вмешаться. Элизабет отражала атаки матери то вполне серьезно, то пытаясь от них отшутиться. Но сколько бы она ни меняла форму своих ответов, решение ее оставалось неизменным.</p>
<p>Между тем мистер Коллинз обдумывал в одиночестве все, что с ним в это утро произошло. Он был слишком высокого мнения о своей особе, чтобы понять причину, из-за которой кузина не захотела принять его предложение. И хотя его самолюбие несомненно было уязвлено, других огорчений он не испытывал. Его склонность к ней была только воображаемой. И, предполагая, что упреки, брошенные матерью в ее адрес, могли быть заслуженными, он едва ли мог о чем-либо сожалеть.</p>
<p>Семейство Беннет пребывало в смятении, когда их навестила Шарлотта Лукас. В прихожей ее встретила Лидия. Бросившись к гостье, она объявила громким шепотом:</p>
<p>— Хорошо, что ты приехала. У нас тут такое творится! Что бы ты думала случилось сегодня утром? Мистер Коллинз сделал предложение Лиззи, а она ему отказала!</p>
<p>Прежде чем Шарлотта успела ответить, в прихожую вбежала Китти, сообщившая ту же новость. И как только девицы вошли в комнату для завтрака, в которой одиноко восседала хозяйка дома, миссис Беннет снова заговорила на ту же тему, взывая к сочувствию мисс Лукас и умоляя ее воздействовать на подругу, чтобы Лиззи уступила наконец чаяниям всей семьи.</p>
<p>— Ради бога, дорогая мисс Лукас, сделайте это, — добавила она удрученно. — Меня никто не поддерживает. Я ни в ком не вижу сочувствия, — все ведут себя просто безжалостно. Хоть бы кто-нибудь вспомнил о моих истерзанных нервах!</p>
<p>Ответу Шарлотты помешало появление Джейн и Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Вот и она сама, — продолжала миссис Беннет. — С нее как с гуся вода. Ей и дела нет до всех нас, будто бы мы все живем где-нибудь в Йорке. Лишь бы ее не трогали! Но я вам вот что скажу, дорогая мисс Лиззи: ежели вы себе вбили в голову, что можете и впредь отказывать всякому жениху, кто бы к вам ни посватался, то вы и вовсе не выйдете замуж! И клянусь вам, мне неизвестно, кто станет о вас заботиться, когда умрет ваш отец. Мне это будет не под силу, запомните. С этого дня я с вами покончила. Больше я с вами не стану разговаривать, — я уже вам это сказала в библиотеке. И вы убедитесь, я сумею сдержать свое слово. Что за удовольствие разговаривать с неблагодарной девчонкой? И вообще, чего ради мне разговаривать с кем бы то ни было? Люди, страдающие больными нервами, не очень-то склонны к разговорам. Увы, моих мучений не понимают! Но этому нельзя удивляться. Кто сам не пожалуется, не дождется сочувствия.</p>
<p>Дочки слушали эти излияния молча, зная, что всякая попытка успокоить и урезонить мать только увеличит ее раздражение. Поэтому миссис Беннет продолжала сетовать на судьбу, пока к ним не присоединился мистер Коллинз, казавшийся еще более напыщенным, чем обычно. При виде его миссис Беннет сказала девицам:</p>
<p>— А теперь я хочу, чтобы вы, — да, да, вы все, — попридержали языки и позволили нам с мистером Коллинзом хоть немножко поговорить по душам.</p>
<p>Элизабет вышла из комнаты, Джейн и Китти последовали за ней, а Лидия не тронулась с места, решив услышать все, что только будет возможно. Шарлотта задержалась, отвечая сначала на любезности мистера Коллинза, который самым подробным образом расспросил обо всех ее родственниках и поинтересовался ее собственным самочувствием, а затем, одолеваемая любопытством, отошла к окну, сделав вид, что оттуда ей ничего не слышно.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет начала подготовленный разговор страдальческим возгласом:</p>
<p>— О, мистер Коллинз!</p>
<p>— Сударыня, — отвечал он, — не будем больше касаться этой темы. Я далек от того, чтобы обидеться на поведение вашей дочери, — продолжал он тоном, в котором все же проскальзывало известное неудовольствие. — Покорность перед неизбежным злом — наш общий долг. Тем более она приличествует молодому человеку, которому, подобно мне, посчастливилось рано выдвинуться в обществе. И потому я заставляю себя покориться. Быть может, правда, с тем большей легкостью, что у меня возникло сомнение — нашел бы я истинное счастье, если бы прелестная кузина удостоила меня своей руки. Ибо я часто наблюдал, что покорность никогда не бывает столь полной, как тогда, когда благо, коего мы лишились, начинает в нашем представлении терять свою ценность. Надеюсь, сударыня, вы не сочтете, что я проявляю неуважение к вашей семье своим отказом от благосклонности вашей дочери, не затруднив вас и мистера Беннета просьбой употребить ради меня родительскую власть. То, что я счел себя свободным, основываясь на ответе вашей дочери, а не ее родителей, может, я опасаюсь, бросить тень на мое поведение. Но всем нам свойственно ошибаться. Во всяком случае, в своих поступках я руководствовался лучшими намерениями. Мне хотелось приобрести приятную спутницу жизни и оказать в то же время услугу вашей семье. И если в чем-то мое поведение все же заслуживает упрека, я, сударыня, умоляю о снисхождении.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XXI</p>
</div>
<p>Волнения по поводу сватовства мистера Коллинза подходили к концу. Элизабет страдала теперь только от оставленного этим событием неприятного осадка и ворчливых упреков, которые еще иногда высказывала по ее адресу миссис Беннет. Что касается самого джентльмена, то он вовсе не выглядел смущенным или подавленным и даже не избегал общества кузины, обнаруживая свои чувства лишь некоторой скованностью и негодующим молчанием. Он почти не разговаривал с ней и в течение всего вечера уделял столь высоко ценимое им внимание одной лишь мисс Лукас. И, охотно поддерживая с ним беседу, Шарлотта оказала подруге и всей ее семье весьма своевременную услугу.</p>
<p>Следующее утро не улучшило здоровья и настроения миссис Беннет. Весь вид мистера Коллинза по-прежнему говорил об уязвленном самолюбии. Элизабет надеялась, что обида заставит его преждевременно покинуть Лонгборн, но планы гостя не изменились: его отъезд был назначен на субботу, и именно в субботу он намеревался от них уехать.</p>
<p>После завтрака девицы отправились в Меритон, чтобы узнать, вернулся ли уже мистер Уикхем, и выразить сожаление по поводу его отсутствия на незерфилдском балу. Он встретил их на окраине города и зашел вместе с ними к миссис Филипс, где его собственная досада и огорчение всех остальных были высказаны достаточно красноречиво. Однако в разговоре с Элизабет он признался, что необходимость его отъезда была преувеличена.</p>
<p>— Когда до бала осталось немного дней, — сказал он, — я понял, что мне лучше не встречаться с мистером Дарси. Я мог бы не вынести длительного пребывания с ним в одной комнате и в одном обществе. А это привело бы к сценам, неприятным не только мне одному.</p>
<p>Элизабет высоко оценила его благоразумие. Им удалось вдоволь наговориться на эту тему и высказать друг другу комплименты, пока Уикхем и еще один офицер сопровождали девиц до Лонгборна. Во время этой прогулки молодой человек оказывал Элизабет особое внимание. Его готовность следовать за ней до самого ее дома была вдвойне приятна Элизабет: во-первых, она была лестна сама по себе, а во-вторых, создавала удобную возможность представить мистера Уикхема ее родителям.</p>
<p>Вскоре после их возвращения старшей мисс Беннет принесли письмо из Незерфилда. Оно было тотчас же распечатано. В конверте лежал красивый листок лощеной бумаги, исписанный изящным дамским почерком.</p>
<p>Пока сестра, задерживаясь на отдельных фразах, читала письмо, Элизабет видела, как менялось выражение ее лица. Джейн вскоре взяла себя в руки и, спрятав письмо, постаралась с обычной веселостью присоединиться к общей беседе. Однако письмо настолько заинтересовало Элизабет, что отвлекло ее внимание даже от Уикхема. Едва Уикхем и его приятель покинули Лонгборн, Джейн взглядом пригласила сестру последовать за ней наверх и, когда они вошли в свою комнату, сказала, снова вынув письмо:</p>
<p>— Оно от Кэролайн Бингли. Я, признаюсь, удивлена его содержанием. К этому времени вся их компания уже, должно быть, покинула Незерфилд и находится на пути в Лондон. И они не собираются возвращаться. Послушай, что здесь написано.</p>
<p>Она прочла первую фразу о том, что сестры мистера Бингли решили последовать за братом в Лондон и намереваются обедать в этот день в доме мистера Хёрста на Гровнор-стрит<a href="#ref22" class="a" onclick="save();">[18]</a>. В следующих строчках говорилось: «Не хочу от Вас скрывать, моя бесценная подруга, что, покидая Хартфордшир, я не жалею ни о чем, кроме Вашего общества. Но будем надеяться, что когда-нибудь нам доведется еще не раз насладиться восхитительной близостью, подобной той, которая существовала между нами в этих местах. А пока что облегчим боль разлуки самой частой и доверительной перепиской. В этом отношении я очень на Вас надеюсь». Эти фальшивые и высокопарные фразы Элизабет выслушала равнодушно. И хотя ее удивила внезапность отъезда сестер мистера Бингли, в полученном известии она не нашла ничего неприятного. Из него вовсе не следовало, что отсутствие мисс Бингли и миссис Хёрст может помешать их брату вернуться в Незерфилд. А разлуку с этими дамами, Элизабет не сомневалась, Джейн перестанет ощущать достаточно быстро, наслаждаясь обществом мистера Бингли.</p>
<p>— Разумеется, жаль, что вам не довелось попрощаться, — сказала она после короткой паузы. — Но разве мы не можем рассчитывать, что счастливая встреча, о которой мечтает мисс Бингли, произойдет раньше, чем она думает? И что восхитительная близость, пережитая вами, когда вы были подругами, возникнет вновь, став еще более приятной, когда вы превратитесь в сестер? Не удержат ведь они мистера Бингли в Лондоне.</p>
<p>— Кэролайн ясно пишет, что никто из них не вернется в Хартфордшир этой зимой. Позволь, я тебе прочту это место.</p>
<p>«Покидая нас вчера, брат воображал, что с делом, вызвавшим его в Лондон, он сможет покончить за какие-нибудь три дня. Но мы хорошо знаем, что это не так. Будучи уверены, что, приехав в город, Чарлз не станет торопиться снова его покинуть, мы решили последовать за ним и избавить его от необходимости проводить часы досуга в неуютной гостинице. Многие из моих знакомых уже съезжаются в город на зиму. Мне бы очень хотелось услышать, что и Вы, моя бесценная подруга, предполагаете оказаться в их числе, но, увы, я не смею на это рассчитывать. Надеюсь от души, что Рождество в Хартфордшире принесет Вам все радости, свойственные этому времени года, и что многочисленность ваших кавалеров не даст Вам ощутить потерю тех трех, которых мы вас лишаем».</p>
<p>— Из этих слов очевидно, — добавила Джейн, — что он не приедет обратно этой зимой.</p>
<p>— Из этих слов очевидно лишь, что он не должен приехать по мнению мисс Бингли.</p>
<p>— Но почему ты так думаешь? Тебе, наверно, кажется, что это его собственное дело, что он сам собой распоряжается? Но ты не знаешь всего. Я прочту тебе то место, которое ранило меня особенно сильно. Мне нечего от тебя скрывать.</p>
<p>«Мистеру Дарси не терпится повидать свою сестру и, откровенно говоря, нам хочется встретиться с ней не меньше, чем ему. Я в самом деле не думаю, чтобы кто-нибудь сравнился с Джорджианой Дарси красотой, изяществом и прочими качествами. Но привязанность, которую она своими совершенствами вызывает во мне и Луизе, становится чем-то более значительным благодаря лелеемой нами надежде, что она станет со временем нашей сестрой. Не помню, говорила ли я Вам раньше о своих предположениях, но мне бы не хотелось покинуть провинцию, не рассказав Вам о них, и я верю, что Вы не поймете их превратно. Мой брат и прежде восхищался мисс Дарси. Теперь же он будет иметь возможность часто встречаться с ней в самой непринужденной обстановке. Все ее родные, так же как и его, желают этой партии. И, надеясь, что меня не обманывают родственные чувства, я считаю Чарлза вполне способным завоевать любое женское сердце. При всех обстоятельствах, способствующих возникновению такой привязанности, и отсутствии каких-либо помех, разве я не права, моя бесценная Джейн, питая надежду на событие, которое столь многим принесет счастье?»</p>
<p>— Что ты скажешь по поводу этой фразы, Лиззи, дорогая? Разве она недостаточно ясна? — спросила Джейн, складывая письмо. — Разве Кэролайн не заявляет без околичностей, что она не хочет стать моей сестрой и не считает это возможным? И что, убежденная в безразличии ко мне мистера Бингли и подозревая, быть может, характер моего чувства к нему, она хочет меня деликатно предостеречь? Можно ли это объяснить по-другому?</p>
<p>— Да, и совсем легко. Я, например, смотрю на это иначе. Сказать тебе, что я думаю?</p>
<p>— Ради бога, скажи.</p>
<p>— Это можно выразить весьма кратко. Мисс Бингли видит, что ее брат влюблен в тебя, но хочет его женить на мисс Дарси. Она следует за ним в Лондон, надеясь, что сможет там его удержать, и старается тебя уверить, что ему до тебя нет дела.</p>
<p>Джейн покачала головой.</p>
<p>— Джейн, милая, ты должна мне поверить! Никто из видевших вас вместе не мог усомниться в его чувствах. В них, конечно, не сомневается и мисс Бингли, — для этого у нее ума хватает. Если бы она заметила в мистере Дарси хоть малую толику тех же чувств к собственной персоне, она бы уже заказывала свадебное платье. Суть дела, однако, в том, что мы для них недостаточно богаты и родовиты. А мисс Бингли хотела бы женить брата на мисс Дарси еще и потому, что, как она полагает, при одной родственной связи между семьями ей будет легче добиться второй. План этот в самом деле не лишен остроумия. Пожалуй, он мог бы увенчаться успехом, не будь у нее на пути дочки леди де Бёр. Но ты же не можешь серьезно думать, что, раз мисс Бингли описала тебе, как ее брат восхищается сестрой мистера Дарси, мистер Бингли стал ценить тебя хоть на йоту меньше, чем когда прощался с тобой после бала во вторник. Или что во власти мисс Бингли внушить ему, что он любит не тебя, а ее обожаемую подругу.</p>
<p>— Если бы мы судили о мисс Бингли одинаково, — ответила Джейн, — твое толкование письма меня бы успокоило. Но я знаю, ты исходишь из неверных предположений. Кэролайн не способна нарочно обманывать. Я могу надеяться только на то, что она сама заблуждается.</p>
<p>— Ну и отлично. Раз мои объяснения для тебя неприемлемы, ты не могла придумать ничего лучшего. Ради бога, считай, что это ее заблуждение. Ты исполнила свой долг и можешь ни о чем не тревожиться.</p>
<p>— Но, Элизабет, дорогая, предположим самое лучшее. Буду ли я счастлива, выходя замуж за человека, сестры и друзья которого хотят, чтобы он женился на другой?</p>
<p>— Это дело твое, — сказала Элизабет. — И если, по зрелом размышлении, ты решишь, что счастливое замужество будет для тебя значить меньше, чем неудовольствие его сестер, я бы тебе советовала ответить ему отказом.</p>
<p>— Как можешь ты так говорить? — сказала Джейн со слабой улыбкой. — Ты же знаешь, сколько бы ни огорчало меня их неодобрение, я бы не колебалась в своем ответе.</p>
<p>— Я в этом уверена. Потому я и не принимаю твоего горя близко к сердцу.</p>
<p>— Но если он не возвратится в течение всей зимы, мой ответ, быть может, даже не потребуется. За шесть месяцев могут возникнуть тысячи новых обстоятельств!</p>
<p>Предположение, что мистер Бингли не вернется в Незерфилд, казалось Элизабет невероятным и представлялось ей вымыслом заинтересованной в этом Кэролайн. Элизабет ни на минуту не допускала, чтобы желание сестры, как бы искусно и настойчиво она ни внушала его брату, могло повлиять на мистера Бингли, человека вполне самостоятельного.</p>
<p>Она убеждала Джейн в своей правоте так горячо, что вскоре с радостью заметила благоприятное действие своих слов. Джейн от природы была не склонна к унынию, и сестре удалось заронить в ней надежду — правда, робкую и иногда омрачаемую сомнениями, — что Бингли возвратится в Незерфилд и ответит каждому движению ее сердца.</p>
<p>Они решили сказать матери лишь об отъезде сестер мистера Бингли из Незерфилда, ничего не говоря о намерениях самого молодого человека. Но даже эти неполные сведения чрезвычайно расстроили миссис Беннет, которая горько сетовала на роковое стечение обстоятельств, заставившее мисс Бингли и миссис Хёрст уехать как раз тогда, когда ее семья так близко с ними сошлась. Однако, погоревав в течение некоторого времени, она утешилась мыслью, что мистер Бингли в скором времени вернется и будет обедать в Лонгборне. И, успокоившись, она в заключение заявила, что, хотя молодой человек приглашен всего-навсего на семейный обед, она не преминет позаботиться, чтобы количество блюд в этот день было удвоено.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА XXII</p>
</div>
<p>Беннеты были приглашены отобедать у Лукасов, и мисс Лукас опять была настолько добра, что в течение большей части дня выслушивала излияния мистера Коллинза. Элизабет воспользовалась случаем, чтобы поблагодарить подругу.</p>
<p>— Разговаривая с тобой, он находится в прекрасном расположении духа, — сказала она. — Я тебе так обязана за эту помощь.</p>
<p>Шарлотта заверила ее, что ей приятно оказаться полезной своим друзьям и что этим с лихвой окупается приносимая ею незначительная жертва. Все это было очень мило с ее стороны. Но великодушие Шарлотты простиралось дальше, чем могла себе представить Элизабет. Ни много ни мало, она имела в виду вовсе избавить подругу от угрозы возобновления мистером Коллинзом его ухаживаний, обратив их на себя самое. И дело подвигалось у нее настолько успешно, что, когда Шарлотта в этот вечер расставалась со своим кавалером, она могла бы почти не сомневаться в достижении цели, не будь срок его пребывания в Хартфордшире столь кратким. Она, однако, недооценила прямолинейности и стремительности его характера, благодаря которым мистер Коллинз на следующее же утро с изумительной ловкостью улизнул из Лонгборна, чтобы поспешить в Лукас Лодж и броситься к ее ногам. Он постарался выбраться из дома тайком, опасаясь, что, если его уход будет замечен, его намерения, которые до того, как они увенчаются успехом, он хотел сохранить в тайне, будут преждевременно разгаданы. Ибо, хотя он почти не сомневался в исходе дела (притом не без основания, так как Шарлотта его достаточно поощрила), в нем все же после случившегося появилась известная неуверенность. Он был принят, однако, самым лестным для себя образом. Заметив его из верхнего окна, когда он подходил к Лукас Лоджу, мисс Лукас выбежала из дома, чтобы как бы невзначай встретиться с ним на садовой дорожке. Едва ли, однако, она осмеливалась предположить, сколько любовного красноречия ожидало ее на месте встречи.</p>
<p>К обоюдному удовлетворению, молодые люди договорились обо всем настолько быстро, насколько это допускали пространные словесные обороты мистера Коллинза. Когда они входили в дом, он уже со всей настойчивостью умолял ее назвать день, который сделает его счастливейшим из смертных. И хотя в данную минуту это его желание еще не могло быть удовлетворено, девица вовсе не была склонна отнестись легкомысленно к счастью своего кавалера. Глупость, которой жених был наделен от природы, лишала предсвадебную пору всякого очарования, ради которого невесте захотелось бы сделать ее более продолжительной. И для мисс Лукас, которая согласилась выйти за него замуж только для того, чтобы устроить свою судьбу, было безразлично, когда именно ее замысел осуществится.</p>
<p>Немедленно было испрошено согласие сэра Уильяма и леди Лукас, данное ими с полной готовностью. Положение мистера Коллинза, занимаемое им даже в настоящее время, делало эту партию весьма удачной для их дочери, за которой они могли дать очень небольшое приданое. К тому же ему предстояло так разбогатеть в будущем! Леди Лукас с интересом, гораздо большим, чем она испытывала к данному предмету когда-либо раньше, стала прикидывать, сколько лет способен протянуть мистер Беннет, а сэр Уильям весьма убежденно заявил, что, когда мистер Коллинз вступит во владение Лонгборном, он и его жена вполне смогут появляться в Сент-Джеймском дворце. Короче говоря, радости всей семьи не было границ. Младшие сестры стали надеяться, что их вывезут в свет на год-два раньше, чем они могли прежде рассчитывать. Братья перестали бояться, что Шарлотта умрет старой девой. Сама она казалась достаточно спокойной. Она достигла своей цели и старалась теперь обдумать создавшееся положение. Выводы ее были в основном удовлетворительными. Мистера Коллинза, разумеется, нельзя было считать ни умным, ни симпатичным человеком; общество его было тягостным, а его привязанность к ней — несомненно воображаемой. Но тем не менее ему предстояло стать ее мужем. Несмотря на то, что она была невысокого мнения о браке и о мужчинах вообще, замужество всегда было ее целью. Только оно создавало для небогатой образованной женщины достойное общественное положение, в котором, если ей не суждено было найти свое счастье, она хотя бы находила защиту от нужды. Такую защиту она теперь получала. И в свои двадцать семь лет, лишенная привлекательности, она прекрасно сознавала, насколько ей повезло. Самой неприятной стороной предстоявшего брака было предчувствие того, как к нему отнесется Элизабет Беннет, чьей дружбой Шарлотта особенно дорожила. Ее подруге новость должна была показаться совершенно невероятной и, возможно, вызвать с ее стороны резкое осуждение. И хотя это обстоятельство не поколебало бы решимости Шарлотты, все же оно могло нанести ей глубокую душевную рану. Она захотела рассказать обо всем подруге сама и потому потребовала от мистера Коллинза, чтобы, вернувшись к обеду в Лонгборн, он ни словом не обмолвился о случившемся. Обещание хранить тайну было дано, разумеется, с полной готовностью. Выполнить его оказалось, однако, не так легко. Долгое отсутствие мистера Коллинза возбудило столько любопытства в семье Беннетов, что по возвращении в Лонгборн он был подвергнут самому тщательному допросу. Уклончивые ответы потребовали от него некоторой изобретательности и в то же время большой самоотверженности, ибо ему очень хотелось похвастаться перед ними своими любовными успехами.</p>
<p>Так как мистеру Коллинзу предстояло на следующее утро покинуть Лонгборн слишком рано, чтобы повидать кого-нибудь из семьи Беннетов при отъезде, церемония прощания произошла перед тем, как дамы должны были отправиться спать. При этом миссис Беннет самым любезным и приветливым образом сказала ему, насколько она будет рада видеть его в Лонгборне, когда дела позволят ему снова их навестить.</p>
<p>— Вашим приглашением, сударыня, — ответил мистер Коллинз, — я особенно дорожу, ибо мечтал его получить. А потому можете не сомневаться, что я им воспользуюсь, как только это станет для меня возможным.</p>
<p>Его ответ удивил всех. Мистер Беннет, которого отнюдь не устраивало быстрое возвращение мистера Коллинза, не замедлил сказать:</p>
<p>— Но не опасаетесь ли вы, сэр, вызвать этим неодобрение леди Кэтрин? Лучше вам пренебречь родственными связями, чем рискнуть обидеть свою патронессу.</p>
<p>— Премного вам обязан, сэр, за дружеское предостережение, — отвечал мистер Коллинз. — Будьте покойны, разумеется, я не предприму столь ответственного шага без соизволения ее светлости.</p>
<p>— Едва ли вы можете оказаться излишне осторожным. Жертвуйте чем угодно, но только не давайте ей повода для малейшего неудовольствия. И если вы увидите, что такой повод может возникнуть из-за нового приезда в Лонгборн — что я считаю вполне вероятным, — спокойно оставайтесь дома. Не тревожьтесь, мы ни в коей мере на вас не обидимся.</p>
<p>— Поверьте, дорогой сэр, вы возбудили во мне самую горячую признательность столь исключительным вниманием к моей особе. И знайте, что в скором времени вы получите от вашего покорного слуги письмо с выражением благодарности за этот и за все другие знаки внимания, оказанные мне во время моего пребывания в Хартфордшире. Что же касается прелестных кузин, то, хотя мое отсутствие может продлиться не столь долго, чтобы сделать это необходимым, я все же позволю себе пожелать им здоровья и благополучия, не исключая и кузину Элизабет.</p>
<p>Вслед за тем дамы с подобающими церемониями удалились, каждая в равной степени изумленная его намерением вскоре вернуться в Лонгборн. Миссис Беннет хотелось объяснить это тем, что он имеет в виду обратить свое внимание на одну из ее младших дочерей. И ей казалось, что Мэри скорее всего согласилась бы принять его предложение. Мэри оценивала его способности значительно выше, чем ее сестры, нередко восхищаясь основательностью его суждений. И, не считая его ум равным своему, она все же полагала, что, последовав ее примеру и занимаясь самоусовершенствованием, он мог бы сделаться достойным ее общества. Увы, все надежды подобного рода были развеяны на следующее же утро. Вскоре после завтрака в доме появилась мисс Лукас и, уединившись с Элизабет, сообщила ей о происшедшей накануне помолвке.</p>
<p>Мысль о том, что мистер Коллинз способен вообразить себя влюбленным в Шарлотту, приходила уже как-то Элизабет в голову. Но подруга, по ее мнению, могла поощрить мистера Коллинза не больше, чем она сама. Ее удивление поэтому было так велико, что в первый момент, нарушив все границы приличия, она воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Помолвлена с мистером Коллинзом? Шарлотта, дорогая, это немыслимо!</p>
<p>Под влиянием столь прямого упрека, выдержка, с которой мисс Лукас рассказала ей эту новость, на миг сменилась растерянностью. Но восклицание Элизабет не превосходило того, к чему ее подруга заранее подготовилась, и, овладев собой, Шарлотта спокойно ответила:</p>
<p>— Неужели это тебя так удивляет, дорогая Элиза? Разве тебе кажется невероятным, чтобы мистер Коллинз заслужил благосклонность какой-либо женщины, если он потерпел неудачу с тобой?</p>
<p>Элизабет опомнилась и, взяв себя в руки, сказала вполне уверенным голосом, как она счастлива породниться с подругой, а также пожелала ей всяческого благополучия.</p>
<p>— Я представляю себе, что ты сейчас должна чувствовать, — сказала Шарлотта. — Ты, вероятно, изумлена, бесконечно изумлена. Ведь еще недавно мистер Коллинз хотел жениться на тебе. Но когда ты сможешь все обдумать, ты, надеюсь, поймешь, что я поступила разумно. Ты знаешь, насколько я далека от романтики. Мне она всегда была чужда. Я ищу крова над головой. И, обдумав характер мистера Коллинза, его образ жизни и положение в обществе, я пришла к выводу, что мои надежды на счастливую семейную жизнь ничуть не уступают надеждам почти всех людей, вступающих в брак.</p>
<p>Элизабет тихо ответила: «О да, разумеется», — и после неловкой паузы подруги вернулись к остальному обществу.</p>
<p>Шарлотта пробыла в Лонгборне совсем недолго, и после ее ухода Элизабет могла поразмыслить над тем, что ей довелось услышать. Прошло немало времени, прежде чем она как-то примирилась с мыслью об этом браке. Два предложения мистера Коллинза, последовавшие одно за другим на протяжении трех дней, по своей нелепости не шли ни в какое сравнение с тем, что второе его предложение было принято. Ей всегда было ясно, что взгляды ее подруги на замужество не совпадают с ее собственными. Но она не могла предположить, что Шарлотта и впрямь решится пожертвовать всеми лучшими чувствами ради мирского благополучия. Ее самая близкая подруга — жена мистера Коллинза! Какая удручающая картина! И боль, вызванная тем, что Шарлотта унизила себя подобным образом, так сильно упав в ее мнении, усугублялась мрачной уверенностью в ее злосчастной судьбе.</p>
<p></span><span id="id24"></span></p>
<div class="title2">
<p>ГЛАВА XXIII</p>
</div>
<p>Элизабет сидела с матерью и сестрами и размышляла об услышанной новости, а также о том, вправе ли она рассказать о ней своим родным, когда в Лонгборн явился сам сэр Уильям Лукас. Шарлотта послала его объявить о ее помолвке с родственником семейства Беннет. Украсив речь множеством адресованных к ним комплиментов и неоднократно поздравив себя с тем, что их семьям суждено породниться, сэр Уильям сообщил изумленным и недоверчивым слушателям о совершившемся событии. Миссис Беннет излишне самоуверенно и недостаточно вежливо заметила, что он глубоко заблуждается, а всегда несдержанная и часто резкая Лидия воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Боже мой! Сэр Уильям, как можете вы рассказывать подобную чепуху? Разве вы не знаете, что мистер Коллинз хочет жениться на Лиззи?</p>
<p>Чтобы без раздражения стерпеть подобные выходки, требовалась обходительность истинного придворного. Однако сэр Уильям был настолько хорошо воспитан, что сумел остаться невозмутимым. И, уверяя их в достоверности своего сообщения, он перенес все дерзкие замечания по своему адресу вполне снисходительно.</p>
<p>Элизабет сочла своим долгом помочь ему выйти из неприятного положения и подтвердила его слова, сказав, что она еще раньше обо всем узнала от самой Шарлотты. Желая прекратить поток удивленных возгласов матери и младших мисс Беннет, она обратилась к сэру Уильяму с подобающими поздравлениями, к которым затем от души присоединилась ее старшая сестра. Свои поздравления Элизабет сопроводила пожеланием счастья жениху и невесте, а также несколькими фразами о превосходном характере мистера Коллинза и о близости Хансфорда к Лондону.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет и в самом деле была так сильно потрясена, что до ухода сэра Уильяма не сказала почти ни слова. Зато как только он ушел, ее чувства тотчас же прорвались. Во-первых, она принялась настаивать, что все это совершенно неправдоподобно. Во-вторых, она не сомневалась, что мистера Коллинза обвели вокруг пальца. В-третьих, она была уверена, что этот брак не принесет счастья. И, наконец, в-четвертых, ей было ясно, что помолвка будет расторгнута. Из всего этого, естественно, вытекали два следствия. Первое — что истинной виновницей всех бед была Элизабет, а второе — что все с ней обращаются просто безжалостно. Оба положения послужили основой для ее высказываний в течение всего дня. Ее нельзя было умиротворить или утешить. И ее негодование не улеглось за день. Прошла неделя, прежде чем она смогла смотреть на Элизабет, не осыпая ее упреками, месяц, прежде чем она стала разговаривать с сэром Уильямом и леди Лукас, не допуская в своей речи колкостей, и много месяцев, прежде чем она нашла возможным простить Шарлотту. Мистер Беннет отнесся к событию гораздо спокойнее. По его словам, оно даже доставило ему известное удовольствие. Особенно его радовало, что в Шарлотте Лукас, которую он привык считать разумной девицей, оказалось ума не больше, чем у его жены, и даже меньше, чем у его собственной дочки.</p>
<p>Джейн не могла не признать, что повторное сватовство мистера Коллинза ее несколько поразило. Но она гораздо меньше говорила о своем удивлении, чем о том, сколько счастья желает она жениху и невесте. Даже Элизабет была не в силах ее убедить, что этот брак вряд ли окажется счастливым. Китти и Лидии не приходило в голову завидовать мисс Лукас, так как мистер Коллинз был всего лишь священником. Для них эта помолвка была одной из новостей, которую следовало разнести по Меритону.</p>
<p>Леди Лукас не могла не торжествовать, получив возможность, в свою очередь, похвастаться перед соседкой удачным замужеством дочери. И она чаще, чем прежде, навещала Лонгборн, чтобы поделиться своими счастливыми переживаниями, хотя хмурые взгляды и ядовитые замечания хозяйки дома могли, казалось, расстроить кого угодно.</p>
<p>Между Элизабет и Шарлоттой возникла натянутость, заставлявшая их обходить деликатную тему, и Элизабет была убеждена, что они уже никогда не смогут по-прежнему относиться друг к другу с доверием. Разочаровавшись в подруге, Элизабет почувствовала еще большую привязанность к Джейн, порядочность и душевное благородство которой, несомненно, не изменили бы ей при любых обстоятельствах. День ото дня она все больше тревожилась о счастье сестры. После отъезда Бингли прошла уже целая неделя, а о нем не было ни слуху ни духу.</p>
<p>Джейн без промедления ответила на письмо Кэролайн и гадала теперь, когда она может ждать от подруги новых вестей. Обещанное благодарственное письмо от мистера Коллинза было получено во вторник. Оно было адресовано мистеру Беннету и содержало выражение такой глубокой признательности, которая у обычного человека могла бы возникнуть после пребывания в чужой семье в течение, по крайней мере, целого года. Исполнив свой долг, мистер Коллинз самым восторженным тоном сообщал, что ему посчастливилось приобрести расположение их прелестной соседки мисс Лукас, добавляя при этом, что только ради возможности наслаждаться ее обществом он с такой готовностью принял великодушное приглашение еще раз навестить Лонгборн, куда, если обстоятельства сложатся благоприятно, он прибудет через две недели в понедельник. Ибо, как он добавлял, леди Кэтрин всем сердцем одобряет его предстоящую женитьбу и желает, чтобы бракосочетание состоялось возможно скорее. Это обстоятельство, бесспорно, послужит весьма веским доводом для его дражайшей Шарлотты, чтобы приблизить день, который сделает его счастливейшим из смертных.</p>
<p>Возвращение мистера Коллинза в Хартфордшир не могло больше радовать миссис Беннет. Напротив, теперь у нее было не меньше причин к неудовольствию по случаю приезда нежеланного гостя, чем у ее мужа. Намерение Коллинза остановиться не в Лукас Лодже, а в Лонгборне казалось достаточно странным и было сопряжено с множеством неудобств и забот. При плохом самочувствии всегда трудно оказывать гостеприимство кому бы то ни было, а влюбленные молодые люди особенно несносны. Таковы были непрерывные сетования миссис Беннет, разнообразившиеся только вспышками еще большего раздражения по поводу длительного отсутствия мистера Бингли.</p>
<p>Джейн и Элизабет были также встревожены этим обстоятельством. День проходил за днем, не принося от Бингли никаких вестей, если не считать распространившегося по Меритону слуха о том, что он вообще не приедет в Незерфилд в течение всей зимы. Слух этот вызывал у миссис Беннет крайнее возмущение, и она не пропускала случая его опровергнуть, называя его скандальной выдумкой.</p>
<p>Даже Элизабет начала опасаться — не равнодушия мистера Бингли, нет, — но того, как бы его сестрам и вправду не удалось задержать его в Лондоне. Она всячески старалась отогнать от себя эту мысль, столь гибельную для счастья Джейн и подвергавшую сомнению стойкость ее избранника. Но мысль эта упорно закрадывалась ей в голову. И Элизабет в самом деле стала бояться, что совместное воздействие его враждебно настроенных сестер и его властного друга, усиленное чарами мисс Дарси и столичными развлечениями, окажется чересчур сильным для его привязанности.</p>
<p>Что касается самой Джейн, неизвестность мучила ее, конечно, еще сильнее, чем Элизабет. Но какие бы чувства ей ни приходилось испытывать, она всячески их скрывала, так что тема эта никогда больше не поднималась в разговорах между сестрами. Миссис Беннет, напротив, не отличалась подобной деликатностью, и редкий час проходил без того, чтобы она не заговорила о Бингли, выражая нетерпение по поводу его задержки или даже требуя, чтобы Джейн подтвердила, как жестоко она будет обманута, если он вообще не вернется. Только безмерная кротость Джейн позволила ей выносить эти нападки, сохраняя внешнее спокойствие.</p>
<p>Мистер Коллинз вернулся в понедельник, через две недели после его отъезда. Его приняли далеко не так радушно, как при первом появлении в Лонгборне. Однако он настолько был полон своими чувствами, что едва ли нуждался во внимании. Целиком занятый ухаживанием за Шарлоттой, он, ко всеобщему удовольствию, весьма редко обременял семью Беннет своим обществом. Большую часть дня он проводил в Лукас Лодже и нередко, возвратясь в Лонгборн, едва только успевал принести извинения за свое долгое отсутствие, как все члены семейства расходились по своим спальням.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет поистине пребывала в самом жалком состоянии. Малейшее упоминание о чем-нибудь, имеющем отношение к женитьбе мистера Коллинза, приводило ее в величайшее расстройство, а вместе с тем, куда бы она ни пошла, всюду только и говорили об этой женитьбе. Самый вид мисс Лукас вызывал в ней отвращение. Достаточно было Шарлотте заглянуть в Лонгборн, как бедной миссис Беннет начинало казаться, что та уже предвкушает час, когда сделается хозяйкой этого дома. И если Шарлотта о чем-нибудь тихо беседовала с Коллинзом, то в воображении миссис Беннет разговор у них непременно шел об их поместье и о выдворении из него хозяйки вместе со всеми ее дочерьми тотчас же после смерти ее мужа. На все это она горько пожаловалась мистеру Беннету.</p>
<p>— Подумайте, мой дорогой, — сказала она, — как тяжело сознавать, что Шарлотта Лукас когда-нибудь окажется здесь хозяйкой. Я увижу ее на своем месте и вынуждена буду убраться восвояси!</p>
<p>— Незачем давать волю столь мрачным мыслям, моя дорогая. Давайте лучше думать о чем-нибудь более приятном и позволим себе надеяться на то, что я переживу Коллинза.</p>
<p>Слова эти не успокоили миссис Беннет в достаточной мере, и вместо ответа она снова заговорила на ту же тему:</p>
<p>— Для меня невыносима мысль, что наше имение достанется этим людям. Если бы оно далось им не по праву наследования по мужской линии, я бы еще могла согласиться…</p>
<p>— С чем именно вы могли бы согласиться?</p>
<p>— Я бы могла согласиться с чем угодно!</p>
<p>— Возблагодарим же небо за то, что вы спасены от подобного состояния полной неопределенности.</p>
<p>— Я, мистер Беннет, никогда не смогу почувствовать благодарность за что-то, имеющее отношение к наследованию по мужской линии. Не могу понять, как только у людей хватает совести отнимать поместье у родных дочерей его владельца. И чтобы это делалось ради какого-то мистера Коллинза! Разве он чем-нибудь это заслужил?</p>
<p>— Предоставляю вам ответить на этот вопрос без моей помощи, — сказал мистер Беннет.</p>

<p>КНИГА ВТОРАЯ</p>

</span>

<p><span><span id="id26"></span></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА I</p>
</div>
<p>От мисс Бингли было получено письмо, рассеявшее всякие сомнения. В первой же фразе сообщалось, что Бингли и его сестры обосновались в Лондоне на всю зиму. Их брат, говорилось далее, весьма сожалел, что перед отъездом ему не удалось засвидетельствовать свое почтение хартфордширским друзьям.</p>
<p>Никаких, решительно никаких надежд больше не оставалось. И когда Джейн смогла вникнуть в окончание письма, она не нашла ничего, что могло бы ее порадовать, кроме вымученных выражений дружеской привязанности. В остальном письмо почти целиком было посвящено прославлению мисс Дарси. Снова подробнейшим образом перечислялись ее многочисленные достоинства. Кэролайн хвалилась возросшей близостью между ними и выражала надежду на осуществление своих чаяний, о которых упоминала раньше. Она также с удовольствием сообщала, что брат ее стал в доме мистера Дарси своим человеком, и добавляла несколько восторженных слов о намерении хозяина дома приобрести новую обстановку.</p>
<p>Элизабет, которой Джейн сразу же пересказала суть письма, выслушала сестру с молчаливым негодованием. Она в равной мере сочувствовала Джейн и сердилась на всех, кто был упомянут в этом письме. Сообщению Кэролайн, что ее брат неравнодушен к мисс Дарси, она не верила. Его чувство к Джейн казалось ей, как и раньше, несомненным. Но хотя ей хотелось относиться к мистеру Бингли по-прежнему благожелательно, она не могла без гнева и даже без некоторого презрения думать о его безволии и нерешительности, превративших его в игрушку коварных друзей. В угоду их прихотям его заставляли жертвовать своим счастьем. Если бы речь шла только о его собственной судьбе, он имел бы право распоряжаться ею как ему заблагорассудится. Но ведь одновременно — и он должен был это сознавать — решалась и судьба ее сестры! Подобные мысли не выходили у нее из головы, не давая никакого успокоения. И сколько бы Элизабет ни думала о том, действительно ли Бингли охладел к Джейн или он поступается своей привязанностью под влиянием близких ему людей, сознает ли он, как глубоко Джейн его полюбила, или ее чувство осталось от него скрытым, — все это могло лишь изменить ее мнение о Бингли, но не смягчало участи бедной Джейн, сердцу которой в любом случае наносилась тяжелая рана.</p>
<p>Целых два дня у Джейн не хватало смелости заговорить с Элизабет о своих переживаниях. Но как-то раз, когда миссис Беннет после особенно пространных рассуждений о Незерфилде и его хозяине оставила их вдвоем, Джейн, не удержавшись, сказала:</p>
<p>— Как бы мне хотелось, чтобы наша дорогая мама умела лучше владеть собой! Ей и в голову не приходит, какую боль она причиняет мне своими непрерывными разговорами о мистере Бингли. Но я не должна впадать в отчаяние. Скоро с этим будет покончено. Он будет забыт, и мы заживем по-прежнему.</p>
<p>Элизабет недоверчиво посмотрела на сестру, но ничего не сказала.</p>
<p>— Ты мне не веришь! — воскликнула Джейн, слегка покраснев. — Но ты ошибаешься. Разве он не может сохраниться в моей памяти только как самый милый из знакомых мне молодых людей? Мне не на что надеяться, нечего опасаться и не в чем его упрекнуть. От этой муки я, слава богу, избавлена. Пройдет лишь короткое время, и я почувствую себя лучше.</p>
<p>Вскоре она добавила более твердым голосом:</p>
<p>— Я утешаю себя, по крайней мере, тем, что все это было лишь игрой моего воображения и кроме меня никому не причинило вреда.</p>
<p>— Джейн, дорогая, — воскликнула Элизабет, — ты слишком добра! Твоя доброта и самоотверженность поистине ангельские. Я не нахожу подходящих слов, но, мне кажется, я никогда тебя не ценила и не любила так, как ты этого заслуживаешь.</p>
<p>Мисс Беннет категорически отвергла подобное восхваление своих достоинств, объяснив его родственными чувствами своей сестры.</p>
<p>— Послушай, Джейн, — отвечала Элизабет, — ведь это несправедливо. Сама ты готова хвалить решительно всех на свете и расстраиваешься, если я хоть о ком-нибудь выскажусь неодобрительно, — а когда я всего-навсего назвала совершенством одну мою бедную сестричку, ты сразу начала со мной спорить. Не бойся, это не распространится на многих, я вовсе не покушаюсь на твою привилегию — смотреть на мир сквозь розовые очки. Этому не бывать — слишком мало людей на свете пользуется моей любовью. А таких, которых я по-настоящему уважаю, еще меньше. Чем больше я наблюдаю мир, тем меньше он мне нравится. Каждый день подтверждает мне несовершенство человеческой натуры и невозможность полагаться на кажущиеся порядочность и здравый смысл. Два отличных урока я получила в последние дни. Об одном я не хочу говорить. А другой дала мне своим обручением Шарлотта. Оно для меня до сих пор остается непостижимым, — как бы я на него ни смотрела.</p>
<p>— Лиззи, милая, не давай воли подобным чувствам. Они разобьют твое сердце. Ты не принимаешь во внимание жизненные обстоятельства и характер каждого человека. Подумай, какое достойное место занимает мистер Коллинз в обществе и как свойственны характеру Шарлотты здравый смысл и благоразумие. Вспомни, как много у нее братьев и сестер и насколько это замужество устраивает ее при ограниченных средствах ее семьи. И постарайся ради нас всех поверить, что она в самом деле может в какой-то мере уважать нашего кузена и относиться к нему с некоторым расположением.</p>
<p>— Ради тебя я, кажется, готова поверить во что угодно. Но от этого едва ли кому-нибудь станет легче. В самом деле, если бы меня убедили, что Шарлотта чувствует к Коллинзу расположение, я стала бы думать об ее уме еще хуже, чем думаю сейчас об ее сердце. Джейн, дорогая, ты не меньше меня знаешь, что мистер Коллинз — человек самодовольный, напыщенный, бездарный и глупый. А потому ты, подобно мне, должна сознавать, что женщина, выходящая за него замуж, не может руководствоваться естественными побуждениями. Не пытайся ее защищать, если этой женщиной оказалась Шарлотта Лукас. Ради одного человека нельзя менять взгляды на порядочность и добродетель. И ты не можешь убедить меня или себя в том, что корыстолюбие — это благоразумие, а пренебрежение здравым смыслом — верный путь к счастью.</p>
<p>— Мне кажется, ты судишь о каждом из них слишком сурово, — ответила Джейн. — И, надеюсь, сама в этом убедишься, когда увидишь, как хорошо сложится у них жизнь. Но довольно об этом. Говоря о двух полученных тобою уроках, ты ведь намекнула еще на одного человека. Я не могла тебя не понять. Умоляю тебя, Лиззи, дорогая, не делай мне больно, обвиняя его и говоря, что он пал в твоем мнении. Мы не должны склоняться к предположению, что нам причинили зло умышленно. Нельзя требовать от жизнерадостного юноши, чтобы он всегда был осмотрителен и следил за каждым своим поступком. Нас часто обманывает собственное тщеславие. Женщины придают слишком большое значение единственному восхищенному взгляду.</p>
<p>— А мужчины стараются их в этом заблуждении поддержать.</p>
<p>— Если мужчиной руководит расчет, он не заслуживает оправдания. Но я не могу поверить, что мир настолько расчетлив, как некоторые думают.</p>
<p>— Я далека от мысли хоть в какой-то мере объяснять расчетом поведение мистера Бингли, — сказала Элизабет. — Но даже не стремясь ко злу и не стараясь сделать кого-то несчастным, можно совершить ошибку и нанести душевную рану. Стоит лишь проявить легкомыслие, недостаток внимания к чувствам других людей, бесхарактерность.</p>
<p>— И ты находишь, что ему свойственно какое-нибудь из этих качеств?</p>
<p>— От первого до последнего. Но я причиню тебе боль, если стану говорить все, что думаю о людях, которыми ты так дорожишь. Постарайся остановить меня, пока не поздно.</p>
<p>— Ты продолжаешь считать, что на него влияют его сестры?</p>
<p>— О да, так же, как и его приятель.</p>
<p>— Не могу этому поверить. К чему это им? Они должны желать ему счастья. А если бы он в самом деле меня полюбил, он бы не нашел счастья ни с какой другой женщиной.</p>
<p>— Ошибка заключается в исходной посылке. Кроме его счастья, они могут преследовать и другие цели, например, увеличение его богатства и веса в обществе или его женитьбу на девушке из хорошего рода, обладающей большими деньгами и связями.</p>
<p>— Конечно, им хотелось бы, чтобы выбор его пал на мисс Дарси, — ответила Джейн. — Но это можно объяснить более благородными чувствами, чем те, которые ты им приписываешь. С ней они познакомились много раньше, чем со мной. Понятно поэтому, что они должны были сильнее к ней привязаться. Но каковы бы ни были их намерения, не станут же они препятствовать стремлениям самого мистера Бингли. Какая сестра, не будучи к этому вынуждена, поступила бы так со своим братом? Если бы они считали, что он меня любит, они не пытались бы нас разлучить, — такая попытка не имела бы успеха. Предполагая в нем такую склонность, ты приписываешь всем ложные и неестественные поступки, а меня ранишь в самое сердце. Не заставляй же меня страдать, настаивая на этой мысли. Я не стыжусь своей ошибки, или, по крайней мере, это чувство стыда — ничто по сравнению с той болью, которую мне пришлось бы испытать, подумай я плохо о нем или об его сестрах. Позволь же мне смотреть на все в благоприятном свете — в таком, в котором их поведение выглядит вполне естественным.</p>
<p>Элизабет не могла отказать ей в этой просьбе. И с этого времени в разговорах между старшими мисс Беннет имя мистера Бингли почти не упоминалось.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет все еще продолжала удивляться и горько сетовать по поводу его отсутствия. И хотя почти каждый день Элизабет растолковывала ей истинное положение вещей, трудно было надеяться, что ее мать когда-нибудь сможет отнестись к отсутствию мистера Бингли с большим спокойствием. Сама не веря своим словам, дочь старалась убедить мать, что ухаживание Бингли за Джейн было следствием легкого и преходящего увлечения, которое исчезло, как только он перестал с ней встречаться. Но хотя миссис Беннет со временем и стала признавать правдоподобность такого взгляда, Элизабет приходилось, по крайней мере, раз в день повторять ей все с начала до конца. По-настоящему ее утешала только мысль о том, что мистер Бингли должен вернуться в Незерфилд к началу лета.</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет отнесся к случившемуся совсем иначе.</p>
<p>— Итак, Лиззи, — сказал он как-то раз, — у твоей сестры, насколько я понимаю, немного разбито сердечко. Поздравь-ка ее от моего имени. Барышни любят время от времени разбивать себе сердце — почти так же, как выходить замуж. Это дает пищу для размышлений и чем-то выделяет их среди подруг. Ну, а когда придет твой черед? Ты ведь не допустишь, чтобы Джейн немного тебя опередила, не так ли? Пора, пора. В Меритоне хватит офицеров, чтобы разбить сердца всем девицам в округе. Не остановиться ли тебе на Уикхеме, а? Отличнейший малый — может вскружить голову кому угодно.</p>
<p>— Благодарю вас, сэр, но меня устроит и не столь блестящий кавалер. Не всем же должно везти так, как Джейн.</p>
<p>— Это верно, — сказал мистер Беннет. — А как приятно сознавать, что у тебя есть заботливая мамаша, которая при подобных обстоятельствах ничего не упустит…</p>
<p>Общество мистера Уикхема принесло жителям Лонгборна немалое облегчение, рассеяв уныние, в которое впали многие члены семьи Беннет под влиянием печальных событий последнего времени. Они видели его весьма часто, и в их представлении к остальным его положительным качествам добавилась еще одна черта: полная откровенность. Все, что Элизабет когда-то услышала от него — о его обиде на мистера Дарси и о причиненном ему этим человеком ущербе, — было объявлено теперь Уикхемом во всеуслышание и обсуждалось публично. И окрестные жители с удовлетворением сознавали, насколько они были правы в своей неприязни к Дарси еще задолго до того, как раскрылось его подлинное лицо.</p>
<p>Старшая мисс Беннет была единственным существом, которое допускало, что в этой истории могут быть какие-то неизвестные хартфордширскому обществу смягчающие обстоятельства. Неизменная кротость побуждала ее ко всему относиться снисходительно и всякое зло объяснять недоразумением. Но все остальные осуждали мистера Дарси как последнего негодяя.</p>
<p></span><span id="id27"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА II</p>
</div>
<p>Наступила суббота, и после недели, потраченной на изъяснения в любви и предвкушение будущего блаженства, мистер Коллинз вынужден был расстаться со своей дорогой Шарлоттой. Боль разлуки, однако, сглаживалась для него заботами о подготовке дома к приему невесты, ибо он имел все основания надеяться, что вскоре после его следующего приезда в Хартфордшир наступит наконец день, который сделает его счастливейшим из смертных. Со своими родственниками в Лонгборне он расстался не менее торжественно, чем в предыдущий раз, снова пожелав здоровья и благополучия своим прелестным кузинам и пообещав прислать второе благодарственное письмо их отцу.</p>
<p>В следующий понедельник миссис Беннет имела удовольствие принять у себя брата и его жену, которые прибыли, чтобы, по обыкновению, провести в Лонгборне Рождество. Мистер Гардинер был рассудительным и достойным человеком, неизмеримо превосходившим свою сестру умственным развитием и душевными качествами. Незерфилдским дамам было бы трудно поверить, что человек, занятый торговлей и проживающий неподалеку от собственного склада товаров, мог быть так хорошо воспитан и так приятен в обращении. Умная, приветливая и изящная миссис Гардинер была на несколько лет моложе миссис Беннет и миссис Филипс. Лонгборнские племянницы ее обожали. Особенно близкая дружба связывала ее с двумя старшими мисс Беннет, которые нередко гостили у нее в Лондоне.</p>
<p>Первым делом миссис Гардинер по приезде в Лонгборн было раздать привезенные подарки и описать новейшие столичные моды. Покончив с этим, она должна была исполнить более скромную роль слушательницы. Миссис Беннет, горько сетуя на судьбу, сообщила ей о множестве печальных событий. Со времени последней их встречи все они натерпелись стольких обид и огорчений! Подумать только, две ее дочери уже вот-вот должны были выйти замуж. И вдруг все пошло прахом…</p>
<p>— Мне не в чем упрекнуть Джейн, — продолжала она. — Если бы она могла, она бы вышла за мистера Бингли. Но Лиззи! Вы не можете себе представить, сестра, как тяжело сознавать, что, если бы не ее дурной нрав, она уже сейчас называлась бы миссис Коллинз! Он сделал ей предложение в этой самой комнате, а она ему отказала. И теперь у леди Лукас дочь окажется замужем раньше, чем у меня! А Лонгборнское имение так и уйдет по мужской линии. Эти Лукасы — удивительно ловкий народ, никогда не упустят своего. Мне грустно говорить о них подобные вещи, но, увы, это в самом деле правда. Я и так совсем больна и издергана, а мне то и дело перечат в собственном доме. Да еще под боком живут соседи, которые думают прежде всего о собственной выгоде. Как хорошо, что вы приехали именно сейчас, — иначе от кого бы мы вовремя узнали, что теперь опять носят длинные рукава!</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер, уже знакомая по письмам Джейн и Элизабет с большинством этих новостей, постаралась ответить возможно более кратко и из сочувствия к племянницам переменила тему разговора.</p>
<p>Оставшись с Элизабет наедине, она снова заговорила о прошедших событиях.</p>
<p>— По-видимому, это и в самом деле была бы для Джейн прекрасная партия, — сказала она. — Как жаль, что она расстроилась! Но такие вещи часто случаются. Молодые люди, подобные мистеру Бингли, — я его себе представила по вашим рассказам, — легко могут влюбиться на короткое время в хорошеньких девушек. А затем, — стоит им только куда-нибудь уехать, — так же легко их забывают. Непостоянство этого рода наблюдается на каждом шагу.</p>
<p>— Прекрасное утешение при описанных вами обстоятельствах, — сказала Элизабет. — Но к нам оно не применимо. Мы пострадали не случайно. Не так часто вмешательство друзей заставляет вполне независимого молодого человека перестать думать о девушке, в которую он был влюблен по уши.</p>
<p>— Выражение «влюблен по уши» настолько избито, обманчиво и неопределенно, что почти ничего не означает. Его одинаково часто употребляют, описывая чувство, возникшее в результате получасового знакомства, и истинно глубокую привязанность. Скажи мне, пожалуйста, мистер Бингли в самом деле был очень влюблен в Джейн?</p>
<p>— Мне еще никогда не приходилось наблюдать более явного увлечения. Он становился все невнимательнее по отношению к окружающим, и его мысли сосредоточивались на ней одной. С каждой их встречей это становилось заметнее. Устроив бал в своем доме, он обидел двух или трех девиц, не пригласив их танцевать. Я сама дважды заговаривала с ним и не получала ответа. Можно ли требовать более убедительных признаков? Разве невнимание к окружающим — не лучшее доказательство влюбленности?</p>
<p>— О, да! Именно такой влюбленности, которую, по моим представлениям, должен был испытывать мистер Бингли. Бедная Джейн! Мне так ее жаль — при ее характере она не скоро оправится, лучше бы это случилось с тобой, Лиззи! При твоем чувстве юмора ты бы справилась с этим гораздо быстрее. Но как тебе кажется, не сможем ли мы уговорить Джейн поехать с нами в Лондон? Перемена обстановки и некоторый отдых от домашних забот могут подействовать на нее благотворно.</p>
<p>Это предложение очень обрадовало Элизабет, и она была убеждена, что Джейн охотно на него согласится.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, — добавила миссис Гардинер, — она не будет связывать эту поездку с мыслями о молодом человеке. Мы живем в другой части города и не имеем с ним общих знакомых. Ты знаешь, мы настолько редко выезжаем из дому, что их встреча в Лондоне кажется почти невероятной — разве только ему самому вздумается ее навестить.</p>
<p>— Это совершенно исключено. Он находится под надзором своего друга. А мистер Дарси не допустит, чтобы его приятель отправился с визитом в такие места. Тетя, дорогая, как вы могли об этом подумать? Быть может, мистер Дарси что-то и слышал о Грейсчёрч-стрит<a href="#ref21" class="a" onclick="save();">[19]</a>. Но он наверняка считает, что ему и за месяц не удалось бы очиститься от грязи, которая пристала бы к нему в этих местах, доведись ему когда-нибудь там побывать. А относительно мистера Бингли вы можете быть совершенно спокойны — он и шагу не смеет ступить без позволения своего наставника.</p>
<p>— Ну что ж, тем лучше. Надеюсь, они больше не встретятся. Впрочем, разве Джейн не переписывается с его сестрой? Мисс Бингли все же не сможет уклониться от визита.</p>
<p>— Я думаю, она вообще покончит с этим знакомством.</p>
<p>Хотя Элизабет высказала последнюю мысль, — как и более важную предыдущую, что мистеру Бингли не позволят встретиться с Джейн, — достаточно решительно, ей бы хотелось продолжить обсуждение этой темы. Поразмыслив, она поняла, что дело вовсе не кажется ей безнадежным. Могло случиться, и иногда это представлялось ей вполне вероятным, что в душе мистера Бингли снова заговорит чувство к Джейн и он преодолеет влияние своих близких под действием более сильной и естественной привязанности к ее сестре.</p>
<p>Мисс Беннет с радостью приняла приглашение тетки. Так как Кэролайн жила отдельно от брата, Джейн могла надеяться изредка проводить с ней утренние часы, не рискуя встретиться со своим бывшим поклонником, — питать другие связанные с этой семьей надежды она себе не позволяла.</p>
<p>Гардинеры прожили в Лонгборне неделю. Благодаря Филипсам, Лукасам и офицерам ***ширского полка за это время не прошло дня без какого-нибудь визита. Миссис Беннет так усердно старалась развлечь брата и невестку, что им ни разу не пришлось пообедать в узком семейном кругу. Если компания собиралась в Лонгборне, там непременно присутствовало несколько офицеров и в их числе, разумеется, мистер Уикхем. Восторженные отзывы Элизабет об этом молодом человеке показались миссис Гардинер подозрительными и заставили ее пристальнее приглядеться к нему и к своей племяннице. Хотя на основании этих наблюдений нельзя было предположить, что они питают друг к другу серьезную привязанность, их очевидная взаимная склонность не могла ее не встревожить. И миссис Гардинер решила непременно поговорить перед отъездом с Элизабет, объяснив ей, насколько неблагоразумно с ее стороны было бы дать волю подобному увлечению.</p>
<p>Случайное обстоятельство стало причиной того, что мистер Уикхем заинтересовал миссис Гардинер не только своей внешностью. Лет десять — двенадцать тому назад, еще до своего замужества, она довольно долго прожила в той самой части Дербишира, откуда Уикхем был родом. У них поэтому оказалось много общих знакомых. И хотя за последние пять лет, с тех пор как умер отец мистера Дарси, Уикхем почти не бывал в родных краях, он все же мог сообщить миссис Гардинер более свежие сведения о ее прежних друзьях, чем те, которыми располагала она сама.</p>
<p>Когда-то миссис Гардинер довелось побывать в Пемберли, и она много знала о его покойном владельце. Это могло служить неисчерпаемой темой для беседы между ними. Обоим доставляло немалое удовольствие сравнивать сохранившиеся у нее воспоминания о Пемберли с более точным описанием поместья, которое мог предложить ее собеседник, и обмениваться восторженными отзывами о покойном мистере Дарси. Узнав, как жестоко поступил с Уикхемом молодой мистер Дарси, она попыталась восстановить в памяти все, что слышала о наследнике Пемберли в то время, когда он был еще подростком. И в конце концов она убедила себя, что припоминает разговоры о гордом и неприятном характере юного Фицуильяма Дарси.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id28"></span></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА III</p>
</div>
<p>Миссис Гардинер не забыла о своем намерении предостеречь Элизабет и при первой же возможности поговорить с племянницей наедине деликатно поделилась с ней своей тревогой. Откровенно высказав все, что ее беспокоило, она продолжала:</p>
<p>— Ты достаточна умна, Лиззи, чтобы влюбиться только из-за того, что тебя от этого предостерегают. Поэтому я не боюсь говорить напрямик. Мне бы очень хотелось, чтобы ты была начеку. Не увлекайся сама и не старайся увлечь его — это будет весьма неблагоразумно, принимая во внимание, какими ничтожными средствами вы оба располагаете. Мне не в чем его упрекнуть. Разумеется, он весьма интересный молодой человек. И если бы он был так богат, как того заслуживает, я считаю, ты не могла бы сделать более удачного выбора. Но при существующих обстоятельствах ты не должна давать воли своему воображению. У тебя есть здравый смысл, и мы все уверены, что ты сумеешь им руководствоваться в своих поступках. Я знаю, как твой отец полагается на твой рассудок и хорошее поведение. Он не должен в тебе разочароваться.</p>
<p>— Тетя, дорогая, вы говорите о таких серьезных вещах!</p>
<p>— Конечно. И я надеюсь, что ты так же серьезно их воспримешь.</p>
<p>— В таком случае вы можете не тревожиться. Я позабочусь о себе и о мистере Уикхеме. И он ни за что в меня не влюбится, если только я смогу этому помешать.</p>
<p>— Элизабет, ты пытаешься отшутиться.</p>
<p>— Прошу прощения. Начну сначала. Сейчас я не влюблена в мистера Уикхема. Могу это заявить вполне уверенно. Но он безусловно — самый привлекательный молодой человек из всех, которых мне приходилось встречать. И если бы он всерьез почувствовал ко мне склонность… я полагаю, было бы гораздо лучше, если бы сего не случилось. Я очень хорошо сознаю, насколько это неблагоразумно. Ах, этот ужасный мистер Дарси!.. Отцовское доверие, конечно, обязывает меня ко многому. И я чувствовала бы себя несчастной, если бы мне пришлось его обмануть. Однако отец весьма расположен к мистеру Уикхему. Короче говоря, тетя, дорогая, мне было бы очень больно кого-нибудь из вас огорчить. Но ведь мы чуть ли не каждый день бываем свидетелями того, что никакая нужда не препятствует влюбленным молодым людям связывать свои судьбы. Как же я могу дать слово, что окажусь перед подобным искушением мудрее моих сверстниц? И ведь мне даже неизвестно, действительно ли я поступлю мудро, заставив себя перед ним устоять. Поэтому все, что я вам могу обещать, это — не торопиться. Я не буду спешить с выводом, что действительно завладела его сердцем. Находясь в его обществе, я не буду к этому стремиться. Короче говоря, я сделаю все, что смогу.</p>
<p>— А не стоит ли ему намекнуть, что он не должен так часто бывать в этом доме? По крайней мере, тебе не следует напоминать матери, чтобы она его приглашала.</p>
<p>— Как я поступила вчера, не так ли? — спросила Элизабет со смущенной улыбкой. — О да, вы правы. С моей стороны было бы гораздо разумнее этого не делать. Но не подумайте, тетя, что он всегда проводит у нас столько времени. На этой неделе его приглашали так часто только из-за вашего приезда. Разве вы не знаете, как мама заботится, чтобы наши друзья были всегда окружены обществом? Право же, даю вам слово по возможности поступать так, как мне будет казаться наиболее разумным. Надеюсь, вы этим довольны?</p>
<p>Тетка заверила ее, что полностью удовлетворена ответом Элизабет, племянница поблагодарила миссис Гардинер за дружескую заботу, и они расстались, вполне расположенные друг к другу, явив миру редчайший пример того, как может быть принят, и притом без всякого негодования, совет столь деликатного свойства.</p>
<p>Мистер Коллинз вернулся в Хартфордшир вскоре после отъезда Гардинеров и Джейн. Но так как на этот раз он уже поселился у Лукасов, его приезд не причинил миссис Беннет больших неудобств. Бракосочетание его теперь быстро приближалось, и хозяйка Лонгборна наконец настолько смирилась, что стала относиться к этому событию как к неизбежному и даже время от времени с кислым видом говорила, насколько ей бы хотелось, чтобы этот брак оказался счастливым.</p>
<p>Свадьба была назначена на четверг, а в среду мисс Лукас нанесла прощальный визит в Лонгборн. Когда она собралась уходить, Элизабет, устыдившись скудных и нелюбезных напутствий, высказанных на прощанье миссис Беннет, и чувствуя себя искренне взволнованной, проводила подругу до крыльца. На лестнице Шарлотта сказала:</p>
<p>— Обещай, Элиза, что будешь мне часто писать.</p>
<p>— Конечно, можешь быть в этом уверена.</p>
<p>— И прошу тебя еще об одном одолжении. Не согласишься ли ты меня навестить?</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, мы будем часто встречаться в Хартфордшире?</p>
<p>— Едва ли я смогу покинуть Кент в ближайшее время. Поэтому обещай мне приехать в Хансфорд.</p>
<p>Элизабет не смогла ей отказать, хотя не предвкушала никаких радостей от подобной поездки.</p>
<p>— Мой отец и Мария должны побывать у меня в марте, — добавила Шарлотта. — Надеюсь, ты сможешь приехать вместе с ними. Поверь, Элиза, твой приезд обрадует меня не меньше.</p>
<p>Бракосочетание состоялось, молодые отбыли в Кент прямо из церкви, и, как обычно, по поводу этого события было немало толков. Вскоре Элизабет получила от подруги письмо. И они стали обмениваться мыслями и наблюдениями не менее часто, чем в прежние времена, хотя и без прежней откровенности. Принимаясь за письмо, Элизабет никогда не могла избавиться от ощущения, что вся прелесть их старой душевной близости утрачена безвозвратно. И, заботясь о постоянстве переписки, она сознавала, что делает это не ради настоящей, а лишь ради их прошлой дружбы. Первые письма Шарлотты прочитывались, разумеется, с большим интересом. Было весьма любопытно узнать, что она расскажет о своем новом доме, как ей понравилась леди Кэтрин и в какой мере осмелится она говорить о своем семейном счастье. Однако, читая их, Элизабет замечала, что по каждому поводу Шарлотта высказывается именно так, как можно было заранее ожидать. Письма были бодрыми, в них говорилось, что она живет, окруженная всеми удобствами, и не упоминалось ничего, что не заслуживало одобрения. Дом, обстановка, соседи и дороги — все пришлось ей по вкусу, а отношение к ней леди Кэтрин было самым дружеским и любезным. Картина, которую рисовала Шарлотта, выглядела так, будто это было разумно смягченное ею изображение Хансфорда и Розингса, вышедшее из-под пера самого мистера Коллинза. Было очевидно, что правильное представление о жизни подруги Элизабет сможет получить, только навестив Хансфорд сама.</p>
<p>Джейн сразу прислала сестре несколько строк, извещая о своем благополучном приезде в Лондон. Элизабет надеялась, что в следующем письме она уже сможет сообщить что-нибудь о семействе Бингли.</p>
<p>Нетерпение, с которым она ждала второго письма, было вознаграждено так, как обычно вознаграждается всякое нетерпение. Проведя неделю в столице, ее сестра ни разу не встретилась с Кэролайн и ничего о ней не слышала. Джейн объяснила это тем, что ее письмо, отправленное подруге еще из Лонгборна, по какой-то причине затерялось.</p>
<p>«Тетушка, — продолжала она, — собирается завтра побывать в той части города, и я воспользуюсь случаем, чтобы нанести визит на Гровнор-стрит».</p>
<p>Следующее письмо было написано после этого визита и встречи с мисс Бингли.</p>
<p>«Кэролайн, по-видимому, была не в духе, — говорилось в письме, — но она очень обрадовалась встрече со мной и упрекнула меня за то, что я не сообщила ей о своем приезде из Лонгборна. Я поэтому была права, предположив, что мое последнее письмо до нее не дошло. Разумеется, я у нее спросила, как поживает ее брат. Он здоров, но так много времени проводит с мистером Дарси, что его сестры почти с ним не видятся. В этот день у них должна была обедать мисс Дарси. Признаюсь, мне очень хотелось на нее посмотреть! Визит мой продолжался недолго, так как Кэролайн и миссис Хёрст куда-то спешили. Смею надеяться, что скоро увижу их теперь у себя».</p>
<p>Прочтя это письмо, Элизабет покачала головой. Было ясно, что о приезде ее сестры в город мистер Бингли сможет узнать только случайно.</p>
<p>Четыре недели прошли со времени приезда Джейн в Лондон, но ей так и не довелось его повидать. Джейн пыталась уверить себя, что нисколько этим не огорчена, но уже не могла не замечать невнимания к себе его сестер. Целых две недели она провела в ожидании мисс Бингли, каждый вечер придумывая для нее новые оправдания, пока наконец Кэролайн не появилась у Гардинеров. Краткость визита и сухость ее манер лишили Джейн возможности обманывать себя дольше. Ее чувства достаточно отразились в письме, которое она написала после этой встречи:</p>
<p>«Я уверена, моя любимая Лиззи не станет торжествовать, убедившись, что она оказалась права и что я глубоко заблуждалась, принимая за чистую монету дружбу мисс Бингли. Но, дорогая сестра, хотя жизнь и доказала твою правоту, не считай меня упрямицей, если я утверждаю и сейчас, что, основываясь на ее прежнем поведении, мое доверие к ней было не менее естественным, чем твоя подозрительность. Для меня остаются непонятными причины, из-за которых она старалась со мной сблизиться. Но если бы прежние обстоятельства повторились, я, несомненно, была бы во второй раз введена в заблуждение. Визит мой не был возвращен Кэролайн до вчерашнего дня. И за все это время я не получала от нее никаких известий, ни одной строчки. С самого ее прихода было очевидно, что встреча ее нисколько не радовала. Она холодно и небрежно извинилась, что до сих пор не удосужилась меня навестить, ни слова не сказала о намерении впредь со мной видеться и казалась настолько изменившейся, что после ее ухода я твердо решила не продолжать с ней знакомства. К моему глубокому сожалению, я не могу ее не осуждать. Ей вовсе не следовало завязывать со мной такую дружбу — уверяю тебя, каждый новый шаг к сближению делался с ее стороны. Но мне ее жаль, потому что она должна сознавать, как нехорошо поступает. А еще потому, что ее поведение, несомненно, вызвано беспокойством за брата. Нет нужды объясняться более подробно. И хотя мы с тобой знаем, что беспокойство ее ни на чем не основано, но, если Кэролайн его испытывает, это вполне объясняет ее обращение со мной. При том, что брат так заслуживает ее любви, всякая ее забота о нем кажется естественной и простительной. Меня, однако, удивляют ее опасения в настоящее время, потому что, если бы он хоть немножко меня помнил, мы бы уже давно встретились. Он знает о моем приезде, я в этом уверена, — она даже сама что-то об этом сказала. И все же, судя по ее тону, ей приходится убеждать себя в том, что он на самом деле любит мисс Дарси. Мне это непонятно. И если бы я не боялась судить слишком резко, у меня был бы большой соблазн сказать, что все это слишком похоже на двойную игру. Но я постараюсь отогнать от себя все мрачные мысли и думать только о радостных вещах: о нашей с тобой дружбе и о бесконечной доброте ко мне моих дорогих дяди и тети. Напиши мне как можно скорее. Мисс Бингли дала мне понять, правда, не совсем уверенно, что ее брат никогда не вернется в Незерфилд и откажется от аренды. Об этом, пожалуй, лучше дома не говорить. Меня очень обрадовали хорошие вести от наших друзей в Хансфорде. Непременно проведай их вместе с сэром Уильямом и Марией. Уверена, что тебе там понравится.</p>
<p><em>Твоя и т. д.»</em></p>
<p>Это письмо причинило Элизабет некоторую боль... Но она воспрянула духом, когда подумала, что Джейн не будет больше обманываться хотя бы в мисс Бингли. Всякие надежды в отношении самого молодого человека исчезли окончательно. Элизабет даже не хотела, чтобы он возобновил свое ухаживание за ее сестрой — так низко он пал в ее глазах. И она искренне пожелала скорейшего заключения его брака с мисс Дарси, который принес бы успокоение Джейн и явился карой для него самого, так как, судя по отзывам Уикхема, Джорджиана быстро заставила бы его пожалеть о той, чьей любовью он так легкомысленно пренебрег.</p>
<p>В эти же дни пришло письмо от миссис Гардинер, где она напоминала Элизабет о ее обещании относительно мистера Уикхема и просила сообщить ей новости. То, что Элизабет могла написать по этому поводу, было гораздо приятнее ее тетке, нежели ей самой. Очевидная склонность к ней Уикхема исчезла, он перестал оказывать ей внимание и ухаживал за другой. У Элизабет хватило наблюдательности, чтобы вовремя это заметить, но она отнеслась к этому спокойно и так же спокойно написала обо всем тетке. Сердце ее было задето не сильно, а ее тщеславие было вполне удовлетворено мыслью, что он остановил бы на ней свой выбор, если бы располагал необходимыми средствами. Внезапное приобретение десяти тысяч фунтов было главным достоинством девицы, которой он теперь старался понравиться. Однако Элизабет, быть может менее объективная в данном случае, нежели в истории с Шарлоттой, не упрекала Уикхема за его стремление к независимости. Напротив, что могло быть естественнее? И даже допуская в душе, что отказ от нее стоил ему некоторой внутренней борьбы, она была готова согласиться с разумностью этого шага, отвечавшего общим интересам, и искренне желала ему счастья.</p>
<p>Все это она сообщила миссис Гардинер. Изложив все обстоятельства, она продолжала:</p>
<p>«Я убедилась, дорогая тетушка, что не была влюблена по-настоящему. Ведь если бы я в самом деле пережила это возвышенное и чистое чувство, то сейчас должна была бы содрогаться даже при упоминании его имени и желать ему всяческих бед. А между тем я отношусь дружески не только к нему самому, но даже к мисс Кинг. Я не могу в себе заметить никакой ненависти к ней и даже не считаю, что о ней нельзя сказать доброго слова. Разве это могло быть любовью? Мое самообладание сослужило мне службу. И хотя для всех знакомых я представляла бы больший интерес, будь я безнадежно в него влюблена, я не могу сказать, что меня печалит моя скромная участь. Слава покупается иногда чересчур дорогой ценой. Китти и Лидия приняли его измену гораздо ближе к сердцу, чем я. Они еще слишком юны, и их глазам еще не открылась беспощадная истина, в силу которой самые привлекательные молодые люди должны иметь средства к существованию в той же мере, как и самые заурядные».</p>

<p>ГЛАВА IV</p>
</div>
<p>Январь и февраль промелькнули без новых важных событий в семье Беннетов и не внесли другого разнообразия в их жизнь, кроме прогулок в Меритон, совершавшихся иногда по замерзшим дорогам, а иногда и по грязи. В марте Элизабет предстояло навестить Хансфорд. Сначала она не думала об этой поездке всерьез. Но мало-помалу она убедилась, что Шарлотта в самом деле ждет ее приезда, и постепенно привыкла смотреть на этот визит как на неизбежную и не такую уж неприятную необходимость. Разлука усилила ее тягу к подруге и ослабила неприязнь к мистеру Коллинзу. Поездка сулила новые впечатления, а так как жизнь с матерью и несносными младшими сестрами едва ли можно было назвать приятной, кратковременная смена обстановки была желательна сама по себе. Путешествие, кроме того, давало ей возможность взглянуть на Джейн. Короче говоря, когда срок визита приблизился, она уже была бы огорчена, если бы его пришлось отложить. Никаких препятствий к поездке, однако, не возникло, и в конце концов все было устроено согласно первоначальному замыслу Шарлотты. Элизабет должна была выехать в сопровождении сэра Уильяма и его второй дочери. Предложение провести ночь в Лондоне было внесено вовремя, и составленный окончательно план путешествия казался безукоризненным.</p>
<p>Единственно, что ее огорчало, — это разлука с отцом, который должен был сильно почувствовать ее отсутствие. И когда пришло время, мистеру Беннету так не хотелось с ней расставаться, что он велел дочке ему написать и чуть ли не обещал прислать ответ.</p>
<p>Прощание с Уикхемом было вполне дружеским, — с его стороны, пожалуй, даже больше, чем дружеским. Новая привязанность не заставила его забыть, что Элизабет первая обратила на себя его внимание, первая его выслушала и выразила ему сочувствие и первая заслужила его восхищение. И в манере, с которой он с ней простился, пожелав ей всяческих радостей, напомнив, чего она может ожидать от леди Кэтрин де Бёр, и выразив уверенность в совпадении их мнений об этой даме и обо всех прочих общих знакомых, заключалось дружеское внимание, которым он, казалось, навсегда завоевал самое искреннее расположение Элизабет. Расставаясь с ним, она была убеждена, что, холостой или женатый, он навсегда останется для нее образцом обаятельного молодого человека.</p>
<p>Спутники Элизабет, составившие ей компанию на следующий день, отнюдь не могли вытеснить в ее душе приятное впечатление, оставленное прощанием с Уикхемом. Сэр Уильям Лукас и его дочь Мария, девица добродушная, но такая же пустоголовая, как и ее папаша, не могли сказать ничего заслуживающего внимания, и к их болтовне Элизабет прислушивалась почти с тем же интересом, как к дребезжанию экипажа. Человеческие причуды всегда привлекали ее внимание, но с сэром Уильямом она была знакома слишком давно. И, рассказывая о церемонии своего представления ко двору, он уже не мог открыть ей ничего нового. А его любезности были такими же затасканными, как и его повествование.</p>
<p>Им предстояло проехать всего двадцать четыре мили, и они выехали достаточно рано, чтобы уже к полудню прибыть на Грейсчёрч-стрит. Когда они подъезжали к дому мистера Гардинера, Джейн стояла у окна гостиной в ожидании их приезда. Она встретила их у входа. Вглядевшись в ее лицо, Элизабет была обрадована цветущим видом сестры. На лестнице их поджидали несколько ребятишек. Желание посмотреть, как выглядит их кузина, заставило их покинуть гостиную, а застенчивость, вызванная годичной разлукой, помешала спуститься ниже. Встреча была проникнута радостью и весельем, и день прошел очень приятным образом: первая его часть — в суматохе и беготне по магазинам, а вторая — в театре.</p>
<p>Элизабет удалось занять место рядом с миссис Гардинер. Их разговор прежде всего коснулся ее сестры. И она была скорее опечалена, нежели удивлена, когда из настойчивых расспросов узнала, что Джейн хотя и старается держать себя в руках, все же иногда впадает в уныние. Вместе с тем можно было надеяться, что это продлится не так долго. Тетушка подробно рассказала о визите мисс Бингли и своих многочисленных беседах со старшей племянницей, свидетельствовавших, что Джейн от всего сердца решила покончить с этим знакомством.</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер не преминула пошутить над Элизабет по поводу измены Уикхема, одновременно поздравив ее с тем, как прекрасно она эту измену перенесла.</p>
<p>— Кстати, дорогая, что за девица эта мисс Кинг? Мне бы не хотелось обнаружить, что наш друг оказался человеком расчетливым.</p>
<p>— Но, тетя, разве можно в матримониальных делах найти точную грань между расчетливостью и благоразумием? Кто знает, где кончается рассудительность и начинается алчность? В дни Рождества вы боялись, как бы он по неблагоразумию не женился на мне. А теперь, когда он пытается заполучить невесту, у которой за душой всего десять тысяч фунтов, вы уже видите в этом корыстолюбие.</p>
<p>— Если ты мне скажешь, что собой представляет мисс Кинг, я смогу составить правильное суждение.</p>
<p>— По-моему, это очень славная девушка. Не могу сказать о ней ничего дурного.</p>
<p>— Но он и внимания не обращал на нее, пока смерть деда не сделала ее обладательницей этой суммы?</p>
<p>— Нет, да и с какой бы стати? Если из-за моей бедности он был не вправе добиваться моего сердца, зачем ему было волочиться за девушкой не богаче меня, не чувствуя к ней расположения?</p>
<p>— Но не кажется ли тебе неприличным, что он обратил на нее внимание тотчас же после получения ею наследства?</p>
<p>— В стесненных обстоятельствах человек не может позволить себе соблюдать все приличия, которые другим кажутся столь обязательными. Если она сама не имеет ничего против, нам-то какое дело?</p>
<p>— Снисходительность мисс Кинг не оправдывает мистера Уикхема. Она лишь доказывает, что ей недостает чего-то самой — ума или такта.</p>
<p>— Ну что ж, — воскликнула Элизабет, — пусть все будет, как вам угодно: он — стяжатель, а она — дура.</p>
<p>— Это вовсе мне не угодно, Лиззи. Неужели ты не понимаешь, что мне бы не хотелось думать плохо о молодом человеке родом из Дербишира?</p>
<p>— Ах, вот что! Ну, если дело только в этом, я не придерживаюсь особенно высокого мнения о молодых людях из Дербишира. И их закадычные друзья, проживающие в Хартфордшире, не намного лучше их самих. Все они мне достаточно отвратительны. Слава богу, завтра я увижу человека без единого положительного качества, не отличающегося ни умом, ни манерами. В конце концов, знаться стоит только с глупцами.</p>
<p>— Берегись, Лиззи. Твои слова слишком отдают разочарованием.</p>
<p>Прежде чем их беседу прервал конец пьесы, Элизабет была неожиданно обрадована, получив приглашение сопровождать мистера и миссис Гардинер во время их летней поездки по стране.</p>
<p>— Мы еще не решили, как далеко заберемся, — сказала миссис Гардинер. — Возможно, мы доедем до Озерного края.</p>
<p>Никакой план не мог бы так обрадовать Элизабет. Она приняла его с готовностью и искренней благодарностью.</p>
<p>— Тетя, милая, дорогая, — воскликнула она с восторгом, — как это замечательно! Вы вдохнули в меня свежие силы, подарили мне жизнь. Прощайте, разочарование и сплин! Что значат люди по сравнению с холмами и скалами? Сколько впереди упоительных часов! И ведь мы — не то что другие путешественники, которые и двух слов связать не могут по возвращении. Уж мы-то, когда вернемся, сумеем рассказать, где мы были, и вспомнить, что повидали. Озера, горы и реки не смешаются в нашей памяти, и мы не станем пререкаться, как это принято, описывая какой-нибудь примечательный вид. А потому наш рассказ не покажется слушателям таким же несносным, как рассказы большинства путешественников.</p>
<p></span><span id="id30"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА V</p>
</div>
<p>Все, что на другой день во время поездки обращало на себя взгляд Элизабет, казалось ей новым и интересным. Сердце ее радостно билось. Вид Джейн доказывал, что за ее здоровье можно не опасаться, а предвкушение путешествия на север служило постоянным источником радостных мыслей.</p>
<p>Когда карета с главной дороги свернула на проселок, ведущий к Хансфорду, путники стали искать глазами приходский домик, который мог теперь открыться за каждым поворотом. Они проехали мимо ограды Розингс-парка, и, вспомнив рассказы об его жителях, Элизабет не могла удержаться от улыбки.</p>
<p>Наконец показалось и само жилище мистера Коллинза. Сад, спускавшийся к дороге, с домом в глубине, зеленая ограда, лавровый кустарник — все свидетельствовало о приближении к цели путешествия. Кланяющиеся и улыбающиеся мистер Коллинз и Шарлотта появились в дверях, и экипаж с кланяющимися и улыбающимися пассажирами остановился у небольшой калитки, отделенной от дома короткой гравиевой дорожкой. Приезжие тотчас вышли из кареты и вместе с хозяевами дома принялись с наслаждением друг друга рассматривать. Миссис Коллинз встретила подругу самым сердечным образом, а Элизабет, видя, как радушно ее принимают, почувствовала еще большее удовлетворение оттого, что решилась на эту поездку. Она сразу заметила, что женитьба нисколько не изменила манер ее кузена, который обычными многоречивыми приветствиями задержал их на несколько минут у калитки, обстоятельно расспрашивая Элизабет обо всех членах ее семьи. Затем они были введены в дом без дальнейших проволочек, если не считать того, что мистер Коллинз обратил внимание приезжих на красоту парадного входа. И как только они оказались в прихожей, он снова напыщенно приветствовал их по поводу вступления в его скромное обиталище, дословно повторив сказанное его женой касательно предстоящего отдыха путешественников.</p>
<p>Элизабет заранее готовилась увидеть Коллинза во всем блеске его величия. И ей трудно было избавиться от мысли, что, указывая на размеры помещения, вид из окон и обстановку, он обращался главным образом к ней, давая почувствовать, чего она лишилась, отказавшись выйти за него замуж. Но хотя все выглядело уютно и мило, она все же была не способна порадовать его ни единым знаком сожаления и поглядывала на подругу, удивляясь, как это ей удается сохранять жизнерадостность, имея такого спутника жизни. Когда мистер Коллинз произносил что-нибудь, от чего его жена могла бы прийти в смущение, — а это случалось нередко, — Элизабет невольно бросала взгляд на Шарлотту. Раз или два она заметила, что подруга слегка покраснела, но в большинстве случаев Шарлотта мудро пропускала подобные высказывания мимо ушей. Просидев в гостиной столько, сколько было необходимо, чтобы воздать должное каждому находившемуся в комнате предмету — от буфета до каминной решетки, — описать их путешествие и рассказать обо всем, что они видели в Лондоне, гости вместе с хозяином вышли в просторный, прекрасно разбитый сад, который мистер Коллинз обрабатывал собственными руками. Работа в саду была для него одним из любимых развлечений, и Элизабет с восхищением наблюдала, как великолепно Шарлотта владеет собой, рассуждая о пользе физического труда и признаваясь, что она всей душой поддерживает эту склонность супруга. Проведя гостей по всем продольным и поперечным дорожкам и не давая им возможности высказать одобрение, которого сам же добивался, мистер Коллинз обратил их внимание на каждый открывавшийся глазам вид, сообщая подробности, от которых самая привлекательная картина теряла всякое очарование. Он мог точно определить, какие поля простираются в каждом направлении, сколько стволов насчитывается в любой, самой отдаленной купе деревьев. Но из всех прекрасных видов, которые могли прославить его сад, графство и даже королевство, ни один не мог сравниться с изумительным видом на Розингс, открывавшийся почти перед самым его домом в прогалине среди окаймлявших парк деревьев. Это было в самом деле красивое современное здание, удачно расположенное на склоне холма.</p>
<p>Из сада мистер Коллинз хотел было провести гостей по двум своим пастбищам, но, так как обувь дам не могла уберечь их ноги от еще не вполне растаявшего снега, с хозяином отправился один сэр Уильям, а Шарлотта позвала сестру и подругу осматривать дом, радуясь возможности сделать это в отсутствие мужа. Дом оказался небольшим, но удобным и отлично спланированным. Все в нем было обставлено и устроено с основательностью и вкусом, свидетельствовавшими о хозяйственных способностях Шарлотты. Отвлекаясь от мыслей о мистере Коллинзе, во всем можно было усмотреть дух благополучия. А по удовлетворенному виду Шарлотты Элизабет заключила, что ее подруга и в самом деле нередко о нем забывает.</p>
<p>Элизабет уже было известно, что леди Кэтрин до сих пор не перебралась из своего поместья в Лондон. Разговор об этом зашел за обедом, и принимавший участие в беседе мистер Коллинз заметил:</p>
<p>— О да, мисс Элизабет, в воскресенье вы будете иметь честь лицезреть леди Кэтрин де Бёр в церкви, и мне нет нужды говорить о том, как сильно вы будете ею восхищены. Моя патронесса — само воплощение любезности и снисходительности, и я не сомневаюсь, что после окончания службы вы удостоитесь какого-нибудь знака внимания с ее стороны. Я даже, почти не колеблясь, могу сказать, что все приглашения, которыми она почтит нас за время вашего пребывания в Кенте, она распространит на вас и на мою сестру Марию. Она необыкновенно внимательна к моей дорогой Шарлотте. Мы обедаем в Розингсе два раза в неделю и никогда не возвращаемся домой пешком: экипаж ее светлости всегда к нашим услугам. Мне следовало сказать, — один из экипажей ее светлости, поскольку их у нее, разумеется, несколько.</p>
<p>— Леди Кэтрин в самом деле весьма степенная и рассудительная дама, — подтвердила Шарлотта. — К тому же она очень внимательная соседка.</p>
<p>— Совершенно верно, дорогая, это как раз то, что я имел в виду. Никакое почтение к столь высокой особе не может оказаться чрезмерным.</p>
<p>Вечер был посвящен главным образом разговорам об уже известных читателю хартфордширских новостях. Перед сном, оставшись в своей комнате одна, Элизабет смогла обдумать, насколько ее подруга удовлетворена своей судьбой, разобраться в образе действий, избранном Шарлоттой по отношению к мужу, и прийти к выводу, что он является наилучшим. Она могла также мысленно представить себе, как будет дальше протекать ее визит в Хансфорд: размеренный ход домашних занятий и бесед с подругой, назойливость мистера Коллинза, курьезные встречи в Розингсе, — картины эти одна за другой промелькнули в ее воображении.</p>
<p>В середине следующего дня, когда Элизабет одевалась в своей комнате перед прогулкой, снизу донесся неожиданный шум. Ей показалось, что весь дом мистера Коллинза пришел в смятение. Прислушавшись, она разобрала, что кто-то весьма поспешно поднимается по ведущей в ее комнату лестнице, выкрикивая на ходу ее имя. Элизабет распахнула дверь и увидела на площадке Марию, которая, захлебываясь от возбуждения, выпалила:</p>
<p>— Элиза, дорогая, ради бога, скорее! Бегите в столовую. Если бы вы знали, что вы увидите из окна! Я вам ни за что не скажу. Скорее, скорее, сию же минуту!</p>
<p>Элизабет тщетно пыталась расспросить Марию о случившемся. Девица не желала ничего говорить, и обе прибежали в столовую смотреть на чудо через окно, которое выходило на проезжую дорогу. Они увидели двух дам, сидевших в низеньком фаэтоне, который остановился у садовой калитки.</p>
<p>— И это все? — воскликнула Элизабет. — Я ожидала, что в сад, по крайней мере, забралась свинья, а это всего лишь леди Кэтрин и ее дочка.</p>
<p>— Ну что вы, дорогая Элиза! — отвечала Мария, явно возмущенная ее ошибкой. — Какая же это леди Кэтрин? Пожилая дама — это миссис Дженкинсон, ее компаньонка, а та, что помоложе, — сама мисс де Бёр! Вы только на нее посмотрите. До чего она крошечная! Кто бы мог подумать, что она такая худенькая и маленькая!</p>
<p>— С ее стороны крайне нелюбезно заставлять Шарлотту стоять на таком ветру. Неужели ей трудно зайти в дом?</p>
<p>— Шарлотта говорит, что она почти никогда к ним не заходит. Появление мисс де Бёр в доме — особая милость с ее стороны.</p>
<p>— Мне ее вид понравился, — сказала Элизабет под действием вновь нахлынувших мыслей. — Она выглядит болезненной и раздражительной. Что ж, она отлично ему подойдет — будет как раз такой женой, какой он заслуживает.</p>
<p>Стоявшие у калитки Шарлотта и мистер Коллинз беседовали с дамами в коляске. В то же время сэр Уильям, к полному удовольствию Элизабет, расположился на крыльце, почтительно созерцая находившуюся перед ним величественную особу и отвешивая поклоны всякий раз, когда на него устремлялся взгляд мисс де Бёр.</p>
<p>В конце концов все было сказано, коляска отъехала, и хозяева вернулись в дом. Лишь только мистер Коллинз увидел обеих барышень, он тут же поздравил их с радостной новостью. Как пояснила Шарлотта, эта новость заключалась в том, что все они приглашены завтра на обед в Розингс.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id31"></span></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА VI</p>
</div>
<p>Торжество мистера Коллинза по поводу полученного приглашения было поистине полным. Больше всего ему хотелось показать гостям величие своей патронессы и дать им воочию убедиться в знаках ее внимания по отношению к миссис Коллинз и его собственной особе. И то, что он столь быстро получил соответствующую возможность, свидетельствовало о таком расположении со стороны леди Кэтрин, которому он никак не мог достаточно надивиться.</p>
<p>— Признаюсь, — говорил он, — мне не показалось бы странным, если бы ее светлость предложила нам выпить с ней чаю и провести в Розингсе воскресный вечер. Более того, зная ее беспредельную доброту, я, говоря откровенно, был даже к этому подготовлен. Но кто бы мог подумать, что она окажет нам столь большое внимание! Кто бы вообразил, что мы получим приглашение на обед, к тому же приглашение на обед для всей нашей компании, почти тотчас же после вашего приезда!</p>
<p>— Меня это ничуть не удивило, — откликнулся сэр Уильям. — Благодаря моему положению в обществе я, слава богу, немного знаком с обычаями великих мира сего. И должен сказать, подобные примеры обходительности при дворе вовсе не считаются редкостью.</p>
<p>В течение остального дня и следующего утра в доме только и было разговоров, что о визите к ее светлости. Мистер Коллинз тщательнейшим образом готовил своих гостей к тому, что их ждет в Розингсе, дабы они не утратили присутствия духа при виде огромных зал, большого количества прислуги и великолепной сервировки.</p>
<p>Прежде чем дамы ушли переодеваться, он нашел нужным дать Элизабет следующий совет:</p>
<p>— Вы можете не тревожиться, дорогая кузина, по поводу вашего костюма. Леди Кэтрин вовсе не ждет от нас той изысканности туалетов, которая свойственна ее светлости и мисс де Бёр. Я бы посоветовал вам просто выбрать платье, которое вам кажется несколько более нарядным, — ничего другого не требуется. Уверяю вас, леди Кэтрин вовсе не подумает о вас хуже, если вы будете скромно одеты. Напротив, ей даже нравится, когда заметно различие в положении.</p>
<p>Пока все одевались, он по два-три раза подходил к каждой двери, советуя поторопиться, так как ее светлость очень не любит, когда ее задерживают с обедом. Столь устрашающее описание леди Кэтрин и ее привычек вконец смутило не привыкшую к обществу Марию Лукас, так что она стала смотреть на свое появление в Розингсе с тем же трепетом, с каким отец ее ждал когда-то представления ко двору.</p>
<p>Воспользовавшись прекрасной погодой, они около полумили прошли по парку пешком. Каждый парк имеет особую красоту и очарование. И Элизабет с удовольствием любовалась представившейся ей картиной, хотя и без того восторга, которого ждал от нее мистер Коллинз. Она не была потрясена даже названным им числом окон на фасаде дома и стоимостью их остекления, когда-то произведенного покойным сэром Льюисом де Бёром.</p>
<p>Робость Марии возрастала с каждым шагом по парадной лестнице дома, и даже сам сэр Уильям не казался в эти минуты вполне спокойным. Элизабет, напротив, не испытывала тревоги. Она не слыхала о каких-либо исключительных талантах или особых добродетелях леди Кэтрин, а что касается признаков знатности и богатства, считала, что сможет созерцать их без особого волнения.</p>
<p>Миновав прихожую, в которой торжествующий мистер Коллинз обратил их внимание на размеры помещения и изящество орнаментов, они следом за слугами прошли через холл в комнату, в которой уже сидели ее светлость, мисс де Бёр и миссис Дженкинсон. Леди Кэтрин снизошла до того, чтобы подняться им навстречу, и, так как Шарлотта заранее условилась с мужем, что она сама представит гостей хозяйке дома, церемония знакомства совершилась естественным образом, без излишних извинений и оправданий, которые не преминул бы высказать по такому случаю мистер Коллинз.</p>
<p>Хотя сэр Уильям когда-то имел честь побывать даже в Сент-Джеймсе, он был сейчас настолько подавлен окружавшим его великолепием, что мог лишь отвесить низкий поклон и затем молча занял предложенное ему место. Его дочка, напуганная почти до бесчувствия, уселась на самый краешек стула, не смея поднять глаза. И только Элизабет не испытывала особого волнения и могла спокойно рассмотреть трех находившихся перед нею дам. Леди Кэтрин оказалась высокой, полной женщиной с резкими чертами лица, которое в давние годы могло быть красивым. Она ничем к себе не располагала, и в ее манерах не чувствовалось желания хозяйки, чтобы ее гости забыли о своем более низком общественном положении. Она не наводила страха молчанием, но все, что она говорила, произносилось не допускающим возражений тоном, подчеркивавшим значительность ее особы, — именно так, как рассказывал мистер Уикхем. И, наблюдая ее в течение всего вечера, Элизабет решила, что леди Кэтрин вполне соответствует нарисованному им портрету.</p>
<p>Рассмотрев хозяйку дома, в лице и жестах которой она вскоре уловила нечто общее с мистером Дарси, Элизабет взглянула на ее дочь и была удивлена ее худобой и тщедушием почти в такой же степени, как Мария Лукас. Между матерью и дочерью не замечалось никакого сходства ни в лице, ни в фигуре. Мисс де Бёр была барышней бледной и болезненной. Лицо ее, хотя и с довольно правильными чертами, казалось невыразительным. Она почти все время молчала, если не считать нескольких фраз, обращенных к миссис Дженкинсон, ничем не примечательной женщине, занятой только разговором с воспитанницей и тем, чтобы получше установить перед ее глазами защитный экран.</p>
<p>Гости не просидели и пяти минут, как их пригласили подойти к окну и полюбоваться открывавшимся из него видом. Мистер Коллинз принялся при этом расхваливать его красоты, а леди Кэтрин снисходительно пояснила, что смотреть на этот вид еще приятнее в летнее время.</p>
<p>Обед оказался превосходным, и, пока он продолжался, им были представлены все предметы сервировки и вся прислуга, обещанные мистером Коллинзом. Как он и предвидел, ему, по желанию ее светлости, пришлось занять место напротив хозяйки дома. При этом он выглядел так, как будто удостоился высочайшей почести в мире. Он орудовал ножом, ел и восхищался каждым подаваемым блюдом. Сначала мнение высказывал мистер Коллинз, а следом за ним — сэр Уильям, который достаточно пришел в себя, чтобы как эхо повторять слова зятя. К удивлению Элизабет, леди Кэтрин не только переносила все это, но даже казалась довольной их чрезмерным восхищением и смотрела на них с самой снисходительной улыбкой, особенно в тех случаях, когда поданное блюдо оказывалось для них совершенно незнакомым. Никакой беседы за столом так и не завязалось. Элизабет была готова поддержать разговор, но она сидела между Шарлоттой и мисс де Бёр. Первая была целиком занята тем, что прислушивалась к словам хозяйки, а вторая ни разу на протяжении обеда не обратилась к Элизабет. Внимание миссис Дженкинсон было полностью поглощено тем, чтобы ее подопечная больше ела, уговорами попробовать еще одно блюдо и расспросами о ее самочувствии. Мария не могла произнести ни слова, а джентльмены все время ели и восторгались.</p>
<p>Когда дамы вернулись в гостиную, Элизабет не оставалось ничего другого, как выслушивать рассуждения леди Кэтрин, продолжавшиеся без перерыва до тех пор, пока не подали кофе. Хозяйка дома высказывала мнения с такой уверенностью, которая свидетельствовала о том, что она не привыкла к возражениям. Она подробнейшим и самым нескромным образом расспрашивала Шарлотту о ее домашних делах, давала ей всевозможные советы, объясняла, как следует вести ее маленькое хозяйство, и наставляла ее в отношении ухода за птицей и коровами. Элизабет поняла, что для этой важной дамы не существовало мелочей, недостойных ее внимания, если только эти мелочи служили ей поводом поучать окружающих. Отвлекаясь от обсуждения различных дел миссис Коллинз, леди Кэтрин обращалась со всевозможными вопросами к Марии и Элизабет. В особенности ее интересовала мисс Беннет, о родне которой ей было известно меньше всего и которую она охарактеризовала, обращаясь к Шарлотте, как вполне приличную и миловидную девицу. Постепенно она разузнала у Элизабет, сколько у нее сестер, старше они или моложе, можно ли надеяться, что какая-нибудь из них выйдет замуж, красивы ли они и где получили воспитание, какой экипаж у ее отца и какова была девичья фамилия ее матери. И хотя Элизабет сознавала бесцеремонность подобного допроса, она давала хозяйке дома каждый раз исчерпывающие ответы. Далее леди Кэтрин заметила:</p>
<p>— Я слышала, имение вашего батюшки наследуется по мужской линии и должно перейти к мистеру Коллинзу? В данном случае, имея в виду ваши интересы, миссис Коллинз, — сказала она, обращаясь к Шарлотте, — я, конечно, не могу этому не радоваться. Но вообще я не одобряю, когда женщин в семье лишают наследственных прав. В семействе сэра Льюиса де Бёра, слава богу, не сочли нужным заводить этот порядок. Вы поете и играете, мисс Беннет?</p>
<p>— Немножко.</p>
<p>— Мы в таком случае будем рады как-нибудь вас послушать. У меня, знаете, превосходный инструмент, верно, получше, чем… Вы сами в этом убедитесь. А ваши сестры тоже поют и играют?</p>
<p>— Да, одна из них.</p>
<p>— Почему же только одна? Нужно было научить всех. У мистера Уэбба музыкой занимались все дочери, а доход у него даже меньше, чем у вашего отца. Вы рисуете?</p>
<p>— К сожалению, нет.</p>
<p>— Как, ни одна из вас?</p>
<p>— Ни одна.</p>
<p>— Странно. У вас, должно быть, не было возможности научиться. Вашей матери следовало каждую весну привозить вас в столицу, чтобы вы могли брать уроки.</p>
<p>— Моя мать не имела бы ничего против, но отец ненавидит Лондон.</p>
<p>— Ваша гувернантка от вас уехала?</p>
<p>— У нас никогда не было гувернантки.</p>
<p>— Не было гувернантки? Просто немыслимо! Пять дочерей воспитаны без гувернантки! Никогда не слыхала ничего подобного. Ваша мать, должно быть, не имела минуты покоя, заботясь о вашем воспитании!</p>
<p>Элизабет едва удержалась от улыбки, заверив леди Кэтрин, что она ошибается.</p>
<p>— Но кто же тогда занимался вашим обучением? Кто за вами следил? Без гувернантки вы были предоставлены самим себе?</p>
<p>— По сравнению с некоторыми семьями это, наверно, так и было. Но те из нас, кто хотел учиться, имели для этого все, что требовалось. Нас всегда поощряли к чтению, и у нас были необходимые учителя. Конечно, если одна из нас предпочитала бездельничать, для этого у нее оставалась полная возможность.</p>
<p>— Еще бы, нисколько не сомневаюсь. С этим-то гувернантке и следует бороться. Если бы я была знакома с вашей матерью, я бы самым решительным образом посоветовала ей нанять гувернантку. Я уже много раз говорила, что в образовании ничего нельзя достигнуть без каждодневных настойчивых упражнений, а это возможно только при наличии гувернантки. Просто удивительно, скольким семьям принесли пользу мои советы. И я всегда с удовольствием помогаю подыскать место молодым особам. Мне, например, удалось отлично пристроить четырех племянниц миссис Дженкинсон. Совсем на днях я порекомендовала одной семье девицу, которую мне только случайно назвали, и, представьте, ею оказались очень довольны. Миссис Коллинз, я не рассказывала вам, что вчера ко мне заезжала леди Меткаф и очень меня благодарила? Подумайте только, она находит, что мисс Поуп — настоящее сокровище. Она прямо так и сказала: «Леди Кэтрин, вы мне подарили сокровище». Ну, а выезжает кто-нибудь из ваших сестер в свет, мисс Беннет?</p>
<p>— Да, сударыня, все.</p>
<p>— Как все? Что же — все пять одновременно? Странно! И вы только вторая дочка в семье! Младшие сестры выезжают в свет, прежде чем старшие вышли замуж! Ваши младшие сестры должны быть еще совсем юными?</p>
<p>— Да, самой младшей нет еще и шестнадцати. Возможно, она и в самом деле слишком молода, чтобы бывать в обществе. Но, по совести говоря, было бы слишком жестоко по отношению к младшим сестрам, если бы они лишились своей доли светских развлечений только из-за того, что старшие не имели возможности или охоты рано выйти замуж. Та, которая родилась последней, имеет такое же право радоваться молодости, как и родившаяся первой. Оказаться лишенной этих радостей из-за того, что ты моложе других! При этом, я полагаю, трудно было бы рассчитывать, чтобы между сестрами существовала достаточная привязанность и они обладали необходимыми душевными качествами.</p>
<p>— Честное слово, вы высказываетесь довольно решительно для столь юной особы, — проговорила леди Кэтрин. — Интересно, сколько вам лет?</p>
<p>— Учитывая, что у меня три взрослые младшие сестры, — ответила Элизабет, улыбаясь, — ваша светлость едва ли полагает, что я назову свой возраст.</p>
<p>Леди Кэтрин, казалось, совершенно опешила, не получив прямого ответа, и Элизабет заподозрила, что ей суждено было быть первым человеком, осмелившимся дать отпор бесцеремонности столь важной особы.</p>
<p>— Вам, я уверена, не может быть больше двадцати. А потому вам незачем скрывать свои годы.</p>
<p>— Увы, мне уже и не двадцать один.</p>
<p>Джентльмены присоединились к ним, и после чаепития появились карточные столы. Леди Кэтрин, сэр Уильям, мистер и миссис Коллинз уселись за кадриль. А так как мисс де Бёр захотелось сыграть в казино<a href="#ref20" class="a" onclick="save();">[20]</a>, двум приезжим девицам вместе с миссис Дженкинсон выпала честь составить ей партию. За их столом царила отменная скука. Едва ли на протяжении всей партии было произнесено хотя бы одно слово, не относившееся к игре, если не считать того, что миссис Дженкинсон иногда беспокоилась, не холодно ли или не жарко ее воспитаннице или не слишком ли ей светло или темно. Другой стол зато отличался значительно большим оживлением. Леди Кэтрин говорила почти беспрерывно, то отмечая ошибки своих партнеров, то рассказывая им какой-нибудь случай из своей жизни. Мистер Коллинз был занят тем, что соглашался со словами ее светлости, благодарил ее за каждое выигранное очко и извинялся, когда полагал, что выиграл их слишком много. Сэр Уильям говорил мало, начиняя память услышанными анекдотами и аристократическими именами.</p>
<p>Когда хозяйке дома и ее дочери игра стала надоедать, столы были убраны. Леди Кэтрин предложила Шарлотте экипаж, и, так как гостья с благодарностью это приняла, хозяйка дала необходимые указания. Вслед за тем все собрались около камина послушать, как леди Кэтрин распорядится относительно завтрашней погоды. Ее предсказания были прерваны прибытием кареты, и, после множества благодарственных речей мистера Коллинза и поклонов сэра Уильяма, они наконец отбыли. Не успели они отъехать, как мистер Коллинз осведомился у Элизабет о ее впечатлениях от Розингса. Ради подруги она постаралась несколько смягчить свое мнение по сравнению с тем, какое сложилось у нее в действительности. Но, несмотря на сделанные ею усилия, выводы ее ни в коей мере не могли удовлетворить мистера Коллинза, которому вскоре пришлось самому приняться за восхваление ее светлости.</p>
<p></span><span id="id32"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА VII</p>
</div>
<p>Сэр Уильям провел в Хансфорде только одну неделю. Но и за этот срок он мог вполне удостовериться в благополучии своей дочери, имевшей счастье приобрести такого супруга и такую соседку, какие не часто встречаются на свете. В продолжение всего визита тестя мистер Коллинз ежедневно выезжал с ним по утрам в своем шарабане, чтобы показать ему окрестные места. Но когда тесть уехал, обитатели Хансфорда вернулись к обычным занятиям. К радости Элизабет, перемена эта не заставила ее проводить в обществе кузена больше времени, чем прежде. В часы между завтраком и обедом хозяин дома теперь либо копался в саду, либо уходил к себе в кабинет и там читал или писал, а то и просто смотрел из окна на дорогу. Дамы проводили время в комнате, окна которой выходили во двор. Сначала Элизабет показалось странным, что Шарлотта предпочитала эту небольшую комнату просторной столовой с более красивым видом. Однако вскоре она поняла, что у ее подруги имелись для такого выбора достаточные основания: будь общая комната расположена так же удачно, как кабинет мистера Коллинза, последний, несомненно, проводил бы гораздо меньше времени в одиночестве. И она вполне согласилась с разумным выбором Шарлотты.</p>
<p>Из своей гостиной дамы не могли наблюдать за дорогой. Поэтому сведениями о проезжающих мимо экипажах и, в частности, о прибытии фаэтона мисс де Бёр, они были целиком обязаны мистеру Коллинзу. Подобные сообщения делались неукоснительно, несмотря на то, что мисс де Бёр заезжала в Хансфорд отнюдь не редко. Обычно она задерживалась около дома и обменивалась несколькими фразами с Шарлоттой, почти никогда не покидая своего экипажа.</p>
<p>Дни, в которые мистер Коллинз не отправлялся в Розингс, выпадали не часто. И почти всегда его жена считала необходимым его сопровождать. Такая готовность Шарлотты жертвовать своим временем оставалась непонятной Элизабет до тех пор, пока она не сообразила, что у леди Кэтрин могли в будущем появиться и другие вакантные церковные приходы. Изредка Коллинзов удостаивала своим визитом сама леди Кэтрин. Во время этих посещений ни одно обстоятельство не ускользало от внимания ее светлости. Бесцеремонно вмешиваясь в их дела, она рассматривала дамское рукоделие, советуя пользоваться иными приемами, находила недостатки в расстановке мебели и разоблачала недобросовестность прислуги. А если она соглашалась разделить с ними трапезу, то, казалось, делала это лишь для того, чтобы обратить внимание на слишком большой кусок жаркого, подаваемый к обеду столь малочисленного семейства.</p>
<p>Элизабет вскоре заметила, что, хотя заботы о судьбах местных жителей могли бы и вовсе не обременять эту важную даму, она тем не менее принимала горячее участие в делах прихода, и все даже самые мелкие из этих дел непременно доводились до ее сведения мистером Коллинзом. И если кто-нибудь из прихожан оказывался недовольным, несговорчивым или, скажем, стесненным в средствах, ее светлость всегда была готова немедленно помчаться в деревню, чтобы рассудить спорщиков, заставить умолкнуть жалобщиков и должным образом водворить общее благополучие и согласие.</p>
<p>Раза два в неделю жителям Хансфорда выпадала честь обедать в Розингсе. И, не считая отсутствия сэра Уильяма, а вместе с ним и второго карточного стола, все последующие обеды ничем не отличались от первого. Иных развлечений жители Хансфорда были лишены почти полностью, так как образ жизни большинства соседних семейств не соответствовал возможностям Коллинзов. Впрочем, Элизабет вовсе от этого не страдала, проводя дни достаточно приятно. Время от времени она могла с удовольствием поболтать полчаса со своей подругой. А необыкновенно хорошая для ранней весны погода позволяла ей почти ежедневно наслаждаться прогулками. И когда все остальные отправлялись с визитом в Розингс, она чаще всего уходила в примыкавшую к ближней стороне парка открытую рощу и бродила там по густо обсаженной деревьями полюбившейся ей дорожке, прелесть которой, казалось, оценила только она одна и где она чувствовала себя достаточно защищенной от любопытства ее светлости.</p>
<p>Так спокойно, без всяких происшествий, протекли первые две недели ее пребывания в Кенте. Приближалась Пасха, и за неделю до праздника население Розингса, прежде столь немногочисленное, заметно пополнилось. Еще вскоре после своего прибытия в Хансфорд Элизабет услышала об ожидающемся в ближайшие недели визите мистера Дарси. И хотя у нее было мало знакомых, с которыми бы она встретилась менее охотно, чем с племянником леди Кэтрин, его приезд обещал дать новую пищу для наблюдений во время визитов в Розингс. При этом, увидев его обращение с кузиной, которую леди Кэтрин прочила ему в жены, она могла бы порадоваться беспочвенности надежд, питаемых в отношении мистера Дарси сестрой мистера Бингли. Леди Кэтрин была весьма довольна ожидавшимся приездом племянника, отзывалась о нем в самых восторженных выражениях и была чуть ли не рассержена, обнаружив, что мисс Лукас и Элизабет успели с ним познакомиться в другом месте.</p>
<p>О приезде Дарси тут же стало известно в Хансфорде, так как мистер Коллинз, жаждавший узнать об этом событии как можно раньше, в течение всего назначенного для приезда утра прогуливался по дороге, с которой можно было беспрепятственно наблюдать за воротами парка. Отвесив поклон прибывшему экипажу в тот самый момент, когда он заворачивал к дому, мистер Коллинз сразу устремился к себе, желая поскорее сообщить важное известие. На следующее утро он поспешил в Розингс, чтобы засвидетельствовать свое почтение. Его приветствие было принято сразу двумя племянниками леди Кэтрин, ибо вместе с мистером Дарси в Розингс приехал еще и младший сын его дяди, лорда***, полковник Фицуильям. И, ко всеобщему изумлению, мистер Коллинз вернулся домой в сопровождении обоих молодых людей. Шарлотта увидела их из окна кабинета в тот момент, когда они пересекали дорогу, и, тотчас же перебежав в гостиную, сообщила девицам об ожидавшей их чести, добавив при этом:</p>
<p>— Этим знаком внимания я, конечно, обязана только тебе, Элиза. Мистер Дарси ни за что не навестил бы так скоро меня одну.</p>
<p>У Элизабет едва хватило времени, чтобы отказаться от комплимента, как зазвенел колокольчик, возвестивший о приходе гостей. И тотчас же после этого трое мужчин вступили в комнату. Вошедшему первым полковнику Фицуильяму можно было дать лет тридцать. Он был не слишком хорош собой, но по обращению и внешности казался истинным джентльменом. Мистер Дарси был в точности таким же, каким его привыкли видеть в Хартфордшире. С обычной сдержанностью он засвидетельствовал свое почтение миссис Коллинз. И каковы бы ни были его чувства к ее подруге, он встретил ее взгляд с полным самообладанием. Элизабет ответила ему едва заметным поклоном, не проронив при этом ни слова.</p>
<p>С легкостью, свойственной хорошо воспитанному человеку, полковник Фицуильям сразу завязал беседу, доставившую удовольствие всем присутствовавшим. Его кузен, обменявшись несколькими словами с Шарлоттой по поводу ее дома и сада, хранил в течение некоторого времени полное молчание. В конце концов, однако, у него хватило любезности осведомиться у Элизабет о здоровье ее семейства. Ответив ему подобающим образом, она, после короткой паузы, добавила:</p>
<p>— Моя старшая сестра последние три месяца провела в Лондоне. Вам не приходилось встречаться?</p>
<p>Она заранее знала, что ответ будет отрицательным. Но ей было любопытно, не выдаст ли он своей осведомленности о том, что произошло между семьей Бингли и Джейн. И, как ей показалось, Дарси слегка смутился, ответив, что ему не посчастливилось увидеть в столице мисс Беннет. Больше об этом не говорилось, и молодые люди вскоре покинули Хансфорд.</p>
<p></span><span id="id33"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА VIII</p>
</div>
<p>Манеры полковника Фицуильяма произвели в Хансфорде самое благоприятное впечатление, и дамы почувствовали, что удовольствие от посещений Розингса с его приездом должно значительно возрасти. Прошло, однако, несколько дней, прежде чем они были туда приглашены. Пока у леди Кэтрин жили ее племянники, она вполне могла обходиться без гостей из пасторского домика. Только в первый день Пасхи, почти через неделю после приезда молодых людей, Коллинзы наконец удостоились приглашения: покидая церковь, леди Кэтрин просила их провести вечер в Розингсе. В последнюю неделю им почти не доводилось видеть леди Кэтрин и ее дочь. Полковник Фицуильям, правда, несколько раз навестил пасторский домик, но мистера Дарси они встретили только в церкви.</p>
<p>Приглашение было, разумеется, принято, и в должный час они появились в гостиной Розингса. Леди Кэтрин встретила их любезно, однако чувствовалось, что их общество уже далеко не так дорого ее сердцу, как в те дни, когда она не могла рассчитывать на чье-либо другое. Сейчас внимание хозяйки было главным образом поглощено обоими племянниками, с которыми — особенно с Дарси — она разговаривала гораздо больше, чем с остальными присутствующими.</p>
<p>По-настоящему их появлением был доволен только полковник Фицуильям. Его радовало все, что хоть как-то помогало ему рассеять скуку пребывания в Розингсе. К тому же хорошенькая подруга миссис Коллинз не на шутку вскружила ему голову. И теперь, усевшись около нее, он так мило болтал с ней о Кенте и Хартфордшире, о домашней жизни и путешествиях, о новых книгах и музыке, что Элизабет впервые испытала удовольствие от посещения этого дома. Живостью и непринужденностью своей беседы они привлекли внимание самой леди Кэтрин и мистера Дарси. Его взгляд не раз останавливался на них с любопытством. То же чувство откровенно выразила хозяйка дома, которая не постеснялась спросить:</p>
<p>— Что это ты там говоришь, Фицуильям? О чем вы толкуете? Нельзя ли и нам услышать, что ты рассказываешь мисс Беннет?</p>
<p>— Мы, сударыня, беседуем о музыке, — сказал он, когда больше уже невозможно было уклоняться от ответа.</p>
<p>— О музыке! Так, ради бога, говорите же громче. Музыка для меня превыше всего. Я не могу молчать, когда говорят о музыке. Я полагаю, в Англии немного людей, которые ценят и понимают музыку больше меня. Если бы только меня с детства ей обучили, я стала бы великой артисткой. Так же, как Энн, будь она только покрепче здоровьем. Уверена, что ее игра доставила бы всем несравнимое наслаждение. А как, Дарси, обстоят дела у Джорджианы?</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси весьма одобрительно отозвался об успехах своей сестры.</p>
<p>— Что ж, я рада услышать о ней столь похвальный отзыв, — произнесла леди Кэтрин. — Пожалуйста, предупреди ее от моего имени, что ей ничего не добиться без достаточного усердия.</p>
<p>— Ручаюсь вам, сударыня, она не нуждается в подобном предостережении, — ответил мистер Дарси. — Она упражняется очень прилежно.</p>
<p>— Тем лучше. Упражнения никогда не могут быть лишними. Когда я буду писать ей в следующий раз, я посоветую ей ни в коем случае не пренебрегать упражнениями. Мне постоянно приходится втолковывать молодым девицам, что без прилежных занятий в музыке нельзя добиться успехов. Ведь вот сколько раз я объясняла мисс Беннет: она не сможет играть по-настоящему хорошо, если перестанет упражняться. И раз у миссис Коллинз нет своего инструмента, она вполне может ежедневно приходить в Розингс и играть на фортепьяно в комнате миссис Дженкинсон. В этой части дома она никому не помешает.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси, казалось, был несколько смущен бестактностью своей тетки и ничего не ответил.</p>
<p>Когда с кофе было покончено, полковник Фицуильям напомнил Элизабет о ее обещании поиграть ему, и она села за фортепьяно. Он придвинул свое кресло поближе. Леди Кэтрин прослушала пьесу до середины, а затем, так же, как и раньше, принялась болтать с другим племянником, пока тот не оставил ее и, перейдя с обычным для него задумчивым видом к инструменту, не расположился таким образом, чтобы лучше видеть лицо хорошенькой исполнительницы. Элизабет это заметила и при первой же удобной паузе сказала ему с лукавой улыбкой:</p>
<p>— Вы хотели меня смутить, мистер Дарси, приготовившись слушать с таким вниманием мою игру. Но я вас нисколько не боюсь, хоть ваша сестра играет столь превосходно. Упрямство не позволяет мне проявлять малодушие, когда того хотят окружающие. При попытке меня устрашить я становлюсь еще более дерзкой.</p>
<p>— Мне незачем доказывать, что вы ошибаетесь, — ответил мистер Дарси. — Не могли же вы в самом деле считать меня на это способным. Я достаточно с вами знаком, чтобы знать, как часто вы утверждаете то, чего вовсе не думаете.</p>
<p>Такой отзыв о ней заставил Элизабет от души рассмеяться. И, обращаясь к полковнику Фицуильяму, она сказала:</p>
<p>— Мистер Дарси может неплохо обрисовать мой характер, научив вас не верить ни одному моему слову. Мне на редкость не посчастливилось; в тех местах, где я надеялась хоть немного пользоваться доброй славой, я встретилась с человеком, способным вывести меня на чистую воду. В самом деле, мистер Дарси, с вашей стороны не великодушно припоминать все дурное, что вы разузнали обо мне в Хартфордшире. Могу добавить, что это и неосторожно, так как может вынудить меня дать вам отпор. И тогда как бы и в отношении вас не открылось нечто такое, что не обрадует ваших близких.</p>
<p>— Я этого не боюсь, — сказал он с улыбкой.</p>
<p>— Ради бога, откройте нам, в чем его можно обвинить, — воскликнул полковник Фицуильям. — Должен же я знать, как он ведет себя за пределами родного дома.</p>
<p>— Ну так вы об этом узнаете! Но приготовьтесь услышать нечто чудовищное. Могу вам сообщить, что в первый раз мы встретились с мистером Дарси в Хартфордшире во время бала. И чем, вы полагаете, он на этом балу отличился? Несмотря на недостаток молодых людей, он соизволил принять участие только в каких-нибудь четырех танцах! Мне жаль вас огорчить, но дело обстояло именно так. Он танцевал лишь четыре раза. И это в то время, когда многие молодые леди вынуждены были сидеть из-за отсутствия кавалеров. Надеюсь, вы не станете этого отрицать, мистер Дарси?</p>
<p>— В тот вечер я не имел чести быть знакомым ни с одной из присутствовавших дам, кроме тех, с которыми приехал на бал.</p>
<p>— О разумеется. И ведь нельзя же было допустить, чтобы вас с кем-нибудь познакомили! Полковник Фицуильям, что я играю дальше? Мои пальцы ждут ваших приказаний.</p>
<p>— Быть может, — сказал Дарси, — обо мне судили бы лучше, если бы я потрудился кому-нибудь представиться. Но я не стремлюсь навязывать свое общество незнакомым людям.</p>
<p>— Не объяснит ли мне ваш кузен, чем это вызвано? — спросила Элизабет, по-прежнему обращаясь к полковнику. — Может быть, он в силах назвать причину, по которой образованный и неглупый человек, к тому же принятый в обществе, не вправе рассчитывать на расширение знакомств?</p>
<p>— Пожалуй, я смог бы ответить на ваш вопрос, не обращаясь к нему, — сказал Фицуильям. — Это, конечно, не относится к мистеру Дарси! Причина может состоять в нежелании доставить беспокойство себе самому.</p>
<p>— Я и вправду лишен присущего некоторым людям таланта, — отвечал Дарси, — свободно болтать с человеком, которого прежде никогда не встречал. Мне нелегко, подобно другим, подлаживаться к тону его рассуждений или делать вид, что меня интересуют его дела.</p>
<p>— Мои пальцы, — сказала Элизабет, — движутся по клавишам этого инструмента не с тем мастерством, какое мне приходилось наблюдать у других музыкантов. Моей игре недостает ни силы удара, ни выразительности, ни беглости. Но мне всегда казалось, что я виновата в этом сама, не дав себе труда поупражняться как следует. Мысль о том, что у меня неподходящие пальцы, почему-то не приходила мне в голову.</p>
<p>Улыбнувшись, Дарси сказал:</p>
<p>— Совершенно с вами согласен. Время, которым вы располагали, вы употребили гораздо лучше. Те, кто пользуется привилегией слушать вашу игру, едва ли заметят ее недостатки. А при посторонних мы с вами не выступаем.</p>
<p>Здесь они были прерваны хозяйкой дома, которая потребовала, чтобы ее посвятили в содержание их разговора. Элизабет тотчас начала новую пьесу. Леди Кэтрин подошла ближе и, немного послушав ее игру, снова заговорила с Дарси:</p>
<p>— Мисс Беннет играла бы неплохо, если бы больше практиковалась и пользовалась указаниями лондонского маэстро. У нее даже есть некоторая беглость, но ей не хватает вкуса, которым отличается Энн. Из моей дочери вышла бы превосходная исполнительница, если бы только здоровье позволяло ей заниматься музыкой.</p>
<p>Элизабет взглянула на Дарси, надеясь понять по его лицу, насколько он присоединяется к восхвалению кузины. Но ни в эту минуту, ни в какую другую она не могла заметить в нем признаков сердечного увлечения. Отношение Дарси к своей кузине позволяло сделать вывод, который весьма порадовал бы мисс Бингли: при равных родственных связях она могла бы с тем же успехом выйти за него замуж, как и мисс де Бёр.</p>
<p>Леди Кэтрин продолжала еще в течение некоторого времени высказывать замечания о музыкальных способностях Элизабет, сопровождая их различными советами о манере игры и музыкальном вкусе. Мисс Беннет переносила это с подобающим гостье терпением. И, подчиняясь просьбам джентльменов, она просидела за инструментом до того времени, когда была подана карета ее светлости, чтобы доставить их в Хансфорд:</p>
<p></span><span id="id34"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА IX</p>
</div>
<p>На следующее утро, когда миссис Коллинз и Мария отправились по делам в деревню, а Элизабет, сидя в одиночестве, писала письмо старшей сестре, ее вдруг потревожил колокольчик, возвестивший о приходе гостей. Хотя она не слышала шума подъехавшего экипажа, ей пришло в голову, что это могла нагрянуть леди Кэтрин. И чтобы избежать назойливых расспросов бесцеремонной посетительницы, она быстро спрятала недописанное письмо. Дверь распахнулась, и, к ее глубочайшему изумлению, в комнату вошел мистер Дарси, притом совершенно один. Гость, казалось, был тоже озадачен тем, что нашел ее в одиночестве, и, принеся свои извинения, сказал, что надеялся застать в этой комнате сразу всех дам.</p>
<p>Они оба сели, и после заданных ею вопросов о здоровье обитателей Розингса наступило молчание, грозившее затянуться на неопределенно долгое время. Совершенно необходимо было придумать какую-нибудь тему для разговора. В эту критическую минуту Элизабет вспомнила, при каких обстоятельствах она в последний раз видела Дарси в Хартфордшире, и ей захотелось узнать, чем он объяснит свой внезапный отъезд из Незерфилда.</p>
<p>— Как неожиданно вы все покинули наши места в ноябре, мистер Дарси! И каким, наверно, приятным сюрпризом для мистера Бингли было увидеть всех вас так скоро после разлуки. Он сам, помнится, выехал в Лондон всего лишь за день до вас, не так ли? Надеюсь, он и его сестры были здоровы, когда вы покинули Лондон?</p>
<p>— Благодарю вас, вполне здоровы.</p>
<p>Она почувствовала, что больше он ничего не скажет, и после короткой паузы продолжала:</p>
<p>— Как мне говорили, у мистера Бингли нет больше желания опять поселиться в Незерфилде?</p>
<p>— Я не слышал, чтобы он об этом упоминал. Но весьма вероятно, что ему не придется проводить там в будущем много времени. У него немало друзей, а сейчас он вступил в тот период жизни, когда число друзей и занятость увеличиваются день ото дня.</p>
<p>— Раз он не намерен жить в Незерфилде, для его соседей было бы лучше, если бы он вообще распрощался с нашим краем. Это поместье могла бы тогда занять другая семья. Впрочем, быть может, мистер Бингли арендовал Незерфилд, заботясь о собственных удобствах больше, чем об удобствах соседей? И следует ждать, что он удержит за собой Незерфилд или откажется от него, руководствуясь теми же побуждениями.</p>
<p>— Меня бы не удивило, — сказал Дарси, — если бы Бингли в самом деле покинул Незерфилд навсегда, представься ему подходящая возможность приобрести дом в другом месте.</p>
<p>Элизабет промолчала. Боясь продолжить разговор о его приятеле и не имея сказать ничего другого, она решила переложить теперь заботу о поддержании беседы на мистера Дарси.</p>
<p>Тот понял намек и вскоре сказал:</p>
<p>— Дом этот выглядит очень уютным. Леди Кэтрин, я полагаю, немало в нем потрудилась, когда мистер Коллинз здесь поселился.</p>
<p>— Думаю, что вы правы. Но она, я уверена, не могла бы уделить внимание более благодарному человеку.</p>
<p>— Мистер Коллинз, кажется, удачно женился.</p>
<p>— Еще бы. Его друзья могут порадоваться, что он встретил одну из немногих разумных женщин, которая согласилась за него выйти и обеспечила ему счастливую жизнь. Моя подруга очень неглупа. Хотя я не уверена, что замужество было самым мудрым из ее поступков. Она, однако, выглядит вполне счастливой, а с точки зрения здравого смысла, брак для нее может считаться весьма удачным.</p>
<p>— Особенно благоприятным кажется то обстоятельство, что она поселилась так близко от родителей и друзей.</p>
<p>— Вы находите, что отсюда до Меритона «так близко»? Но ведь здесь чуть ли не пятьдесят миль.</p>
<p>— Что значат пятьдесят миль хорошей дороги? Чуть больше, чем полдня пути. Мне кажется, это весьма короткое расстояние.</p>
<p>— Мне бы не пришло в голову оценивать преимущества брака милями, — сказала Элизабет. — И я вовсе не считаю, что миссис Коллинз поселилась поблизости от родителей.</p>
<p>— Это свидетельствует о вашей привязанности к Хартфордширу. Все, что находится не совсем рядом с Лонгборном, кажется вам отдаленным.</p>
<p>Он проговорил это с улыбкой, которая его собеседнице показалась понятной. По-видимому, он считал, что ее слова относятся к Незерфилду и к Джейн. И, покраснев, она ответила:</p>
<p>— Я вовсе не хотела сказать, что, выйдя замуж, женщина любое расстояние от дома своих родителей должна воспринимать как большое. Близость и отдаленность — понятия относительные, зависящие от обстоятельств. Там, где богатство делает дорожные расходы несущественными, расстояние перестает быть злом. Но в данном случае это отнюдь не так. Коллинзы имеют приличный доход, которого не может, однако, хватить для частых разъездов. И я убеждена, что моя подруга не считала бы, что она живет близко от родительского дома, даже если бы расстояние до него было вдвое короче пути из Кента в Хартфордшир.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси подвинул свой стул немного ближе и сказал:</p>
<p>— Не следует так привязываться к родным местам. Не сможете же вы всю жизнь провести в Лонгборне!</p>
<p>Элизабет была удивлена его словами. Но настроение Дарси переменилось, он отодвинулся, взял со стола газету и, глядя поверх нее, произнес более холодным тоном:</p>
<p>— Как вам понравился Кент?</p>
<p>За этим последовал обмен мнениями о здешних местах, достаточно краткий и сдержанный с обеих сторон. Он был прерван возвращением Шарлотты и ее сестры, которые немало удивились столь неожиданному tete-a-tete. Мистер Дарси объяснил им свою ошибку, из-за которой мисс Беннет пришлось прервать свои занятия, и, просидев почти в полном молчании еще несколько минут, удалился.</p>
<p>— Что бы это могло означать? — спросила Шарлотта, как только он ушел. — Элиза, дорогая, он, должно быть, в тебя влюблен — иначе он ни за что бы так запросто к нам не пришел.</p>
<p>Но когда она узнала от Элизабет, как мало он ей сказал, подобная догадка уже не показалась убедительной даже заинтересованной Шарлотте. И после ряда предположений визит Дарси в конце концов пришлось объяснить только отсутствием у него лучшего способа провести время. В самом деле, охотничий сезон уже миновал. В Розингсе была леди Кэтрин, книги и бильярд. Но не могут же мужчины проводить весь день взаперти! Привлеченные близостью пасторского дома, или прелестью ведущей к нему дороги, или, наконец, удовольствием от встречи с его обитателями, но с этих пор оба кузена стали наведываться туда чуть ли не ежедневно. Они приходили в утренние часы, иногда врозь, иногда вместе, а иной раз и в сопровождении своей тетки. Для дам было ясно, что появления полковника Фицуильяма объясняются тем, что ему нравится их общество — качество, особенно его рекомендовавшее. Удовольствие, которое получала Элизабет в его присутствии, и впечатление, которое она на него производила, напомнили ей об ее прежнем избраннике, Джордже Уикхеме. И хотя, сравнивая обоих, она видела, что в манерах полковника недостает подкупающей задушевности ее меритонского приятеля, ей казалось, что он зато значительно лучше образован.</p>
<p>Но почему в Хансфорде так часто появлялся мистер Дарси, — было решительно непонятно. Он явно не нуждался в собеседниках, так как нередко в течение многих минут не произносил ни единого слова. И даже когда он наконец начинал говорить, казалось, что он делает это лишь по необходимости, а не из душевной потребности, ради приличия, а не для собственного удовольствия. Он редко бывал по-настоящему оживленным. Миссис Коллинз просто не знала, что и подумать. Поскольку полковник Фицуильям время от времени подтрунивал над его рассеянным видом, можно было предположить, что обычно он ведет себя по-другому. Собственное ее знакомство с Дарси не позволяло ей судить об этом с уверенностью. Разумеется, она была бы не прочь объяснить эту перемену влюбленностью в ее подругу и всячески старалась в этом удостовериться. Шарлотта стала внимательно следить за Дарси, когда им случалось навещать Розингс или когда он приходил в Хансфорд, но так и не смогла добиться в своих наблюдениях заметного успеха. Несомненно, он часто останавливал взор на Элизабет, однако выражение его лица при этом можно было толковать по-разному. Этот взор был пристальным и серьезным, но Шарлотта нередко сомневалась, заключает ли он в себе какое-то чувство. Иногда ей просто казалось, что, глядя на ее подругу, Дарси думает о чем-то другом.</p>
<p>Раз или два она пыталась поделиться с Элизабет своими догадками относительно возможной влюбленности Дарси, но та обращала этот разговор в шутку. И Шарлотта не сочла более возможным настаивать, опасаясь вызвать надежды, которые могли бы привести к напрасному разочарованию. В самом деле, она нисколько не сомневалась, что неприязнь, питаемая ее подругой к мистеру Дарси, сразу бы исчезла, как только она вообразила бы, что он находится в ее власти.</p>
<p>Желая своей подруге всяческого добра, Шарлотта иногда задумывалась о возможности ее брака с полковником Фицуильямом. Это был, вне всякого сомнения, приятнейший человек. Элизабет ему явно нравилась, и он занимал прекрасное положение в обществе. Однако, в противовес этим преимуществам, Дарси был патроном многих церковных приходов, тогда как у его кузена не имелось в распоряжении ни одного.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА Х</p>
</div>
<p>Гуляя по парку, Элизабет несколько раз неожиданно сталкивалась с мистером Дарси. Первую встречу в той части парка, в которой она до сих пор никогда никого не видела, она объяснила досадной случайностью. Чтобы избежать в будущем таких недоразумений, Элизабет с первого же раза дала ему понять, что постоянно выбирает для прогулки эти места. Каким образом подобные встречи могли повториться, было совершенно необъяснимо. Тем не менее Дарси оказался на ее пути во второй и даже в третий раз. Можно было подумать, что он делает это ей назло или занимается самоистязанием, так как, увидев ее, вместо того чтобы сказать несколько общих фраз и после неловкой паузы удалиться, он находил нужным свернуть со своей тропинки и пойти с ней рядом. Он всегда был немногословен, — Элизабет тоже не утруждала себя поисками тем для беседы. Однако при третьей встрече она обратила внимание на его странные, бессвязные вопросы о том, нравится ли ей Хансфорд, любит ли она гулять в одиночестве и что она думает о супружеском счастье мистера и миссис Коллинз. Он говорил о Розингсе и о том, что у нее должно было сложиться не вполне правильное представление об этом доме, как будто предполагал, что при новом визите в Кент ей предстоит там остановиться. Это как бы подразумевалось в его словах. Неужели он намекал на полковника Фицуильяма? Ей казалось, что дело клонится к этому, если он действительно что-то имел в виду. И, почувствовав себя задетой, она была рада наконец оказаться у садовой калитки неподалеку от пасторского домика.</p>
<p>Во время одной из прогулок, когда она перечитывала последнее письмо Джейн, раздумывая над теми его строками, где печаль сестры звучала особенно сильно, она была вновь потревожена приближающимися шагами. Однако, подняв глаза, вместо мистера Дарси она увидела идущего ей навстречу полковника Фицуильяма. Быстро спрятав письмо и заставив себя улыбнуться, она воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Не думала я, что могу встретить вас в этих местах!</p>
<p>— Раз в году я обычно совершаю обход всего парка, — ответил полковник. — А сейчас мне бы хотелось навестить Хансфорд. Вы далеко направляетесь?</p>
<p>— Нет, я как раз собиралась идти обратно. И она действительно повернула и пошла с ним к дому священника.</p>
<p>— Вы в самом деле уезжаете в субботу? — спросила Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Да, если только Дарси снова не отложит отъезд. Я вынужден к нему приноравливаться. А он подчиняется своим прихотям.</p>
<p>— И, будучи господином прихотливым, он находит удовлетворение в том, что подчиняет себе окружающих? Мне еще не приходилось видеть человека, который больше него дорожил бы правом всегда поступать по собственному усмотрению.</p>
<p>— Да, он хочет сам распоряжаться своей судьбой, — отвечал полковник Фицуильям. — Но ведь это свойственно каждому. Отличие Дарси заключается в том, что у него больше возможностей удовлетворить это желание. Он достаточно богат, тогда как многие другие бедны. Я это знаю слишком хорошо. Младший сын должен привыкнуть к зависимости и необходимости отказывать себе на каждом шагу.</p>
<p>— А мне казалось, что младшему сыну графа ни то, ни другое незнакомо<a href="#ref19" class="a" onclick="save();">[21]</a>. Скажите честно, много ли вы знали зависимости и лишений? Разве из-за отсутствия денег вам когда-нибудь не удавалось отправиться в задуманное путешествие или приобрести вещь, которую вам хотелось иметь?</p>
<p>— Все это относится к жизни в семье. И, быть может, я не вправе утверждать, что пережил много затруднений такого рода. Но в более значительном деле нехватка средств способна причинить серьезные огорчения. Младшие сыновья, например, не могут жениться на девушке, которая им пришлась по душе.</p>
<p>— Если только им не пришлась по душе достаточно богатая наследница, что, я думаю, с ними обычно случается.</p>
<p>— Привычка жить на широкую ногу делает нас слишком зависимыми от денег. Между людьми моего круга не много смельчаков, позволяющих себе вступить в брак, не задумываясь о средствах, которыми они смогут в дальнейшем располагать.</p>
<p>«Неужели эти слова предназначены для меня?» — подумала Элизабет, покраснев. Однако, взяв себя в руки, она ответила, улыбаясь:</p>
<p>— Но скажите мне, ради бога, почем теперь младшие сыновья графа? Если старший брат не дышит на ладан, младший, я полагаю, едва ли стоит больше пятидесяти тысяч?</p>
<p>Он ответил в том же духе, и разговор прекратился. Чтобы нарушить молчание, которое он мог приписать действию высказанного им намека, она сказала:</p>
<p>— Мне кажется, ваш кузен захватил вас с собой главным образом, чтобы кем-нибудь распоряжаться. Но я не понимаю, почему бы ему не жениться и не обеспечить себя постоянным удобством такого рода. Впрочем, возможно, для этой цели ему пока подходит его сестра. Мистер Дарси ее единственный опекун — он вправе командовать ею, как ему вздумается.</p>
<p>— О нет, — сказал полковник Фицуильям, — этой привилегией ему приходится делиться со мной. Ответственность за судьбу мисс Дарси лежит на мне так же, как и на нем.</p>
<p>— В самом деле? Ну и как же вы справляетесь с вашей обязанностью? Много ли она причиняет хлопот? Молодыми девицами ее возраста иногда не так-то просто руководить. А если еще у нее настоящая натура Дарси, она вполне может захотеть поступить по-своему.</p>
<p>Произнеся это, она заметила, что он взглянул на нее очень внимательно. Серьезность, с которой он спросил, почему она считает, что мисс Дарси способна причинить беспокойство, подтвердила, что ее предположение недалеко от истины. Элизабет ответила без промедления:</p>
<p>— Можете не тревожиться — ничего дурного я о ней не слыхала. Хоть я и вправе считать, что едва ли о какой-нибудь девице говорится так много, как о мисс Дарси. В ней души не чают две знакомые мне особы — миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли. Кажется, вы говорили, что вам приходилось с ними встречаться?</p>
<p>— Я с ними немножко знаком. Их брат — большой друг Дарси, славный молодой человек.</p>
<p>— О да, — хмуро произнесла Элизабет. — Мистер Дарси необыкновенно добр по отношению к мистеру Бингли и очень о нем заботится.</p>
<p>— Очень заботится? Что ж, я и в самом деле думаю, что Дарси неплохо о нем позаботился — как раз тогда, когда Бингли в этом нуждался. Из нескольких слов, сказанных Дарси на пути в Кент, я понял, что его друг перед ним в немалом долгу. Впрочем, как бы мне не пришлось просить у Дарси прощения, — я толком не знаю, что речь шла о Бингли. Это всего лишь мои предположения.</p>
<p>— А что вы имеете в виду?</p>
<p>— Так, одно обстоятельство, сведения о котором Дарси не захотел бы сделать всеобщим достоянием. Они могли бы дойти до семейства одной особы, что было бы весьма неприятно.</p>
<p>— Будьте спокойны, я о них не проговорюсь.</p>
<p>— Не забывайте при этом, что, может быть, он подразумевал вовсе не Бингли. Он сказал лишь, что вправе поздравить себя со спасением друга от неприятностей, связанных с неразумной женитьбой. Но ни имен, ни подробностей я от него не слышал. Я заключил, что дело касается Бингли, только потому, что, как мне кажется, тот вполне способен попасть в подобное положение. К тому же они с Дарси провели вместе прошлое лето.</p>
<p>— А назвал ли вам мистер Дарси причины, которые заставили его вмешаться в дела его друга?</p>
<p>— Насколько я понял, девица вызывала серьезные возражения.</p>
<p>— Каким же способом вашему кузену удалось их разлучить?</p>
<p>— Он об этом не говорил, — улыбаясь, сказал Фицуильям. — Я вам передал все, что известно мне самому.</p>
<p>Элизабет ничего не ответила. Сердце ее кипело от гнева. Подождав немного, Фицуильям осведомился о причине ее задумчивости.</p>
<p>— Я размышляю о том, что сейчас узнала, — ответила она. — Поступок вашего кузена мне не очень понравился. Кто он такой, чтобы считать себя судьей?</p>
<p>— По-вашему, его вмешательство было бесцеремонным?</p>
<p>— Я просто не понимаю, какое право имел мистер Дарси решать, разумна или неразумна привязанность его друга. Как мог он один судить — с кем Бингли найдет свое счастье. Однако, — добавила она, опомнившись, — раз мы не знаем подробностей, мы не вправе его упрекать. Должно быть, привязанность была с обеих сторон не очень глубокой.</p>
<p>— Вполне разумное предположение! — воскликнул Фицуильям. — Хотя и не слишком лестное для оценки его заслуг.</p>
<p>Слова эти были сказаны в шутку. Но эта шутка настолько соответствовала ее представлению о мистере Дарси, что, не доверяя своему самообладанию, Элизабет побоялась на нее ответить. Она перевела разговор на случайную тему и продолжала его до самых дверей пасторского дома. Закрывшись после ухода Фицуильяма в своей комнате, она могла без помех обдумать услышанное во время прогулки. Трудно было предположить, что речь шла не о близких ей людях. В мире не могло существовать двух человек, находившихся под таким неограниченным влиянием мистера Дарси. О некотором его участии в событиях, разлучивших Бингли и Джейн, она подозревала и раньше. Но руководство и главную роль в этих событиях она всегда приписывала мисс Бингли. Оказывалось, однако, если только Дарси не обманывало собственное тщеславие, что именно он, именно его высокомерие и самонадеянность были причиной всех прошлых и будущих горестей Джейн. Не кто иной, как он, лишил всякой надежды на близкое счастье самое нежное и благородное сердце на свете. И едва ли можно было предугадать, как долго оно не оправится от полученной раны.</p>
<p>«Девица вызывала серьезные возражения!» — сказал полковник. По-видимому, эти серьезные возражения состояли в том, что один ее дядя был провинциальным стряпчим, а второй — лондонским коммерсантом.</p>
<p>— Против самой Джейн никто не посмел бы ничего возразить! — воскликнула Элизабет. — Столько в ней прелести и обаяния! Настолько она разумна и так хорошо умеет себя держать! Ничего нельзя было бы сказать и против нашего отца. При всех его причудах, даже мистер Дарси не мог отрицать его здравого смысла, его высокой порядочности, — такой, которой самому мистеру Дарси, наверное, никогда не достичь!</p>
<p>Элизабет вспомнила о матери и почувствовала себя менее уверенно. Но она все же не допускала мысли, что Дарси серьезно покоробили недостатки миссис Беннет. Гордость Дарси, очевидно, страдала бы сильнее, породнись его друг с людьми неподобающего круга, нежели — ограниченного ума. И мало-помалу она убедила себя, что поступок Дарси объяснялся его крайним высокомерием и желанием выдать за Бингли свою сестру.</p>
<p>Пережитое ею душевное потрясение привело к слезам и головной боли, которая к вечеру еще больше усилилась. Это обстоятельство, так же как нежелание встретиться с Дарси, заставило ее отказаться от посещения Розингса, куда Коллинзы были приглашены к чаю. Видя, что подруге ее в самом деле нездоровится, миссис Коллинз не стала настаивать и, по возможности, оградила ее от назойливых уговоров своего мужа. Последний, впрочем, не посмел умолчать, что отсутствие Элизабет может вызвать неудовольствие леди Кэтрин.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id36"></span></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XI</p>
</div>
<p>Когда они ушли, Элизабет, как бы желая еще больше настроить себя против мистера Дарси, стала перечитывать полученные ею в Кенте письма Джейн. В них не было прямых жалоб. Сестра не вспоминала о недавних событиях и ничего не говорила о своих теперешних переживаниях. Но любое письмо, почти любая строка свидетельствовали об исчезновении обычной для прежних писем Джейн жизнерадостности, которая была так свойственна царившему в ее душе миру и расположению к людям. Каждую проникнутую печалью фразу Элизабет замечала теперь гораздо явственнее, чем при первом чтении. Бесстыдная похвальба мистера Дарси столь успешным вмешательством в чужую судьбу позволила ей еще острее осознать глубину горя, пережитого ее бедной сестрой. И ей искренне хотелось, чтобы оставшиеся до его отъезда два дня миновали возможно скорее. То, что через две недели ей предстояло снова встретиться с Джейн и при этом предпринять для восстановления ее душевного спокойствия все, к чему способна истинная привязанность, было единственно приятной стороной ее размышлений.</p>
<p>При мысли об отъезде из Кента мистера Дарси она не могла не вспомнить, что вместе с ним Кент должен покинуть и его кузен. Но полковник Фицуильям достаточно ясно намекнул ей на отсутствие каких-либо серьезных намерений с его стороны. И, как бы ни было ей приятно его общество, она вовсе не собиралась расстраиваться по поводу предстоящей разлуки.</p>
<p>Именно тогда, когда она вполне уяснила для себя это обстоятельство, она вдруг услышала звонок колокольчика. Подумав, что неожиданный посетитель — сам полковник Фицуильям, который однажды примерно в этот же час уже навещал их и мог зайти снова, чтобы справиться о ее здоровье, Элизабет почувствовала легкое волнение. Но ее предположение рассеялось и мысли приняли другой оборот, когда, к величайшему изумлению, она увидела вошедшего в комнату мистера Дарси. Гость сразу же осведомился о ее недомогании и объяснил свой визит желанием удостовериться, что ее самочувствие улучшилось. Она ответила с холодной учтивостью. Он немного посидел, затем встал и начал расхаживать по комнате. Элизабет была озадачена, но ничего не говорила. После нескольких минут молчания он стремительно подошел к ней и сказал:</p>
<p>— Вся моя борьба была тщетной! Ничего не выходит. Я не в силах справиться со своим чувством. Знайте же, что я вами бесконечно очарован и что я вас люблю!</p>
<p>Невозможно описать, как его слова ошеломили Элизабет. Растерянная и покрасневшая, она смотрела на него и молчала. И, обнадеженный ее молчанием, Дарси поторопился рассказать ей обо всем, что пережил за последнее время и что так волновало его в эту минуту. Он говорил с необыкновенным жаром. Но в его словах был слышен не только голос сердца: страстная любовь звучала в них не сильнее, чем уязвленная гордость. Его взволнованные рассуждения о существовавшем между ними неравенстве, об ущербе, который он наносил своему имени, и о семейных предрассудках, до сих пор мешавших ему открыть свои чувства, убедительно подтверждали силу его страсти, но едва ли способствовали успеху его признания.</p>
<p>Несмотря на глубокую неприязнь к мистеру Дарси, Элизабет не могла не понимать, насколько лестна для нее любовь подобного человека. И, ни на секунду не утратив этой неприязни, она вначале даже размышляла о нем с некоторым сочувствием, понимая, как сильно он будет расстроен ее ответом. Однако его дальнейшие рассуждения настолько ее возмутили, что гнев вытеснил в ее душе всякую жалость. Решив все же совладать со своим порывом, она готовилась ответить ему, когда он кончит, возможно спокойнее. В заключение он выразил надежду, что согласие мисс Беннет принять его руку вознаградит его за все муки страсти, которую он столь тщетно стремился подавить в своем сердце. То, что она может ответить отказом, явно не приходило ему в голову. И, объясняя, с каким волнением он ждет ее приговора, Дарси всем своим видом показывал, насколько он уверен, что ответ ее будет благоприятным. Все это могло вызвать в душе Элизабет только еще большее возмущение. И как только он замолчал, она, вспыхнув, сказала:</p>
<p>— Чувство, которое вы питаете, независимо от того — разделяется оно человеком, к которому оно обращено, или нет, — свойственно, я полагаю, принимать с благодарностью. Благодарность присуща природе человека, и, если бы я ее испытывала, я бы вам сейчас это выразила. Но я ее не испытываю. Я никогда не искала вашего расположения, и оно возникло вопреки моей воле. Мне жаль причинять боль кому бы то ни было. Если я ее совершенно нечаянно вызвала, надеюсь, она не окажется продолжительной. Соображения, которые, по вашим словам, так долго мешали вам уступить вашей склонности, без труда помогут вам преодолеть ее после этого объяснения.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси, облокотясь на камин, пристально смотрел на Элизабет. Ее слова изумили его и привели в негодование. Лицо его побледнело, и каждая черта выдавала крайнее замешательство. Он старался сохранить внешнее спокойствие и не произнес ни слова, пока не почувствовал, что способен взять себя в руки. Возникшая пауза показалась Элизабет мучительной. Наконец он сказал нарочито сдержанным тоном:</p>
<p>— И этим исчерпывается ответ, который я имею честь от вас получить? Пожалуй, я мог бы знать причину, по которой вы не попытались облечь свой отказ по меньшей мере в учтивую форму? Впрочем, это не имеет значения!</p>
<p>— С таким же правом я могла бы спросить, — ответила она, — о причине, по которой вы объявили, — с явным намерением меня оскорбить и унизить, — что любите меня вопреки своей воле, своему рассудку и даже всем своим склонностям! Не служит ли это для меня некоторым оправданием, если я и в самом деле была с вами недостаточно любезна? Но у меня были и другие поводы. И вы о них знаете. Если бы даже против вас не восставали все мои чувства, если бы я относилась к вам безразлично или даже была к вам расположена — неужели какие-нибудь соображения могли бы склонить меня принять руку человека, который явился причиной несчастья, быть может непоправимого, моей любимой сестры?</p>
<p>При этих ее словах мистер Дарси изменился в лице. Но овладевшее им волнение скоро прошло, и он слушал Элизабет, не пытаясь ее перебить, в то время как она продолжала:</p>
<p>— У меня есть все основания составить о вас дурное мнение. Ваше злонамеренное и неблагородное вмешательство, которое привело к разрыву между мистером Бингли и моей сестрой, не может быть оправдано никакими мотивами. Вы не станете, вы не посмеете отрицать, что являетесь главной, если не единственной причиной разрыва. Бингли заслужил из-за него обвинение в ветрености и непостоянстве, а Джейн — насмешку над неоправдавшимися надеждами. И они оба не могли не почувствовать себя глубоко несчастными.</p>
<p>Она остановилась и с возмущением заметила, что он ее слушает, вовсе не обнаруживая сожаления о случившемся. Напротив, он даже смотрел на нее с усмешкой напускного недоверия.</p>
<p>— Можете ли вы утверждать, что это — не дело ваших рук? — повторила она.</p>
<p>Его ответ был нарочито спокойным:</p>
<p>— Я не намерен отрицать, что в пределах моих возможностей сделал все, чтобы отдалить моего друга от вашей сестры, или что я доволен успехом моих усилий. О Бингли я позаботился лучше, чем о самом себе.</p>
<p>Элизабет сделала вид, что это любезное замечание прошло мимо ее ушей. Но смысл его не ускользнул от ее внимания и едва ли мог сколько-нибудь умерить ее гнев.</p>
<p>— Но моя неприязнь к вам, — продолжала она, — основывается не только на этом происшествии. Мое мнение о вас сложилось гораздо раньше. Ваш характер раскрылся передо мной из рассказа, который я много месяцев назад услышала от мистера Уикхема. Что вы можете сказать по этому поводу? Каким дружеским участием вы оправдаетесь в этом случае? Или чьим неправильным толкованием ваших поступков вы попробуете прикрыться?</p>
<p>— Вы весьма близко к сердцу принимаете судьбу этого джентльмена, — вспыхнув, заметил Дарси уже менее сдержанным тоном.</p>
<p>— Может ли остаться равнодушным тот, кому сделались известны его утраты?</p>
<p>— Его утраты? — с презрением повторил Дарси. — Что ж, его утраты и в самом деле велики.</p>
<p>— И в этом виновны вы! — с жаром воскликнула Элизабет. — Вы довели его до нищеты — да, это можно назвать нищетой! Вы, и никто другой, лишили его тех благ, на которые он был вправе рассчитывать. Вы отняли у него лучшие годы жизни и ту независимость, которая принадлежала ему по праву и по заслугам. Все это — дело ваших рук! И при этом вы еще позволяете себе посмеиваться над его участью?!</p>
<p>— Ах, вот как вы судите обо мне! — воскликнул Дарси, быстро шагая из угла в угол. — Вот что вы обо мне думаете! Благодарю за откровенность. Судить по-вашему — я и впрямь кругом виноват. Но, быть может, — сказал он, останавливаясь и поглядев на нее в упор, — мои прегрешения были бы прощены, не задень вашу гордость мое признание в сомнениях и внутренней борьбе, которые мешали мне уступить моим чувствам? Не мог ли я избежать столь тяжких обвинений, если бы предусмотрительно от вас это скрыл? Если бы я вам польстил, заверив в своей всепоглощающей страсти, которую бы не омрачали противоречия, доводы рассудка или светские условности? Но притворство мне отвратительно. Я не стыжусь чувств, о которых вам рассказал. Они естественны и оправданны. Могли ли вы ждать, что мне будет приятен круг людей, в котором вы постоянно находитесь? Или что я стану себя поздравлять, вступая в родство с теми, кто находится столь ниже меня на общественной лестнице?</p>
<p>Возмущение Элизабет росло с каждой минутой. Однако, отвечая ему, она всячески старалась сохранить внешнее спокойствие.</p>
<p>— Вы глубоко заблуждаетесь, мистер Дарси, думая, что на мой ответ повлияла манера вашего объяснения. Она лишь избавила меня от сочувствия, которое мне пришлось бы к вам испытывать, если бы вы вели себя так, как подобает благородному человеку.</p>
<p>Она заметила, как он вздрогнул при этих словах. Но он промолчал, и она продолжала:</p>
<p>— В какой бы манере вы ни сделали мне предложение, я все равно не могла бы его принять.</p>
<p>На лице его снова было написано удивление. И пока она говорила, он смотрел на нее со смешанным выражением недоверия и растерянности.</p>
<p>— С самого начала я бы могла сказать: с первой минуты нашего знакомства ваше поведение дало мне достаточно доказательств вашей заносчивости, высокомерия и полного пренебрежения к чувствам тех, кто вас окружает. Моя неприязнь к вам зародилась еще тогда. Но под действием позднейших событий она стала непреодолимой. И не прошло месяца после нашей встречи, как я уже ясно поняла, что из всех людей в мире вы меньше всего можете стать моим мужем.</p>
<p>— Вы сказали вполне достаточно, сударыня. Я понимаю ваши чувства, и мне остается лишь устыдиться своих собственных. Простите, что отнял у вас столько времени, и примите мои искренние пожелания здоровья и благополучия.</p>
<p>С этими словами Дарси покинул комнату, и в следующее мгновение Элизабет услышала, как он открыл входную дверь и вышел из дома. Все ее чувства находились в крайнем смятении. Не имея больше сил сдерживать себя, она села в кресло и полчаса, совершенно обессиленная, заливалась слезами. Снова и снова перебирала она в памяти подробности только что происшедшей сцены. И ее удивление непрерывно возрастало. Ей сделал предложение мистер Дарси! Мистер Дарси влюблен в нее в течение многих месяцев! Влюблен настолько, что решился просить ее руки, вопреки всем препятствиям, из-за которых он расстроил женитьбу Бингли на Джейн и которые имели по меньшей мере то же значение для него самого! Все это казалось невероятным. Сделаться невольным предметом столь сильной привязанности было, конечно, весьма лестно. Но гордость, страшная гордость мистера Дарси, его бесстыдная похвальба своим вмешательством в судьбу Джейн, непростительная уверенность, что он при этом поступил правильно, бесчувственная манера, с какой он говорил об Уикхеме, и его жестокость по отношению к этому молодому человеку, которую он даже не пытался опровергнуть, — все это быстро подавило в ее душе всякое сочувствие, на мгновение вызванное в ней мыслью о его любви.</p>
<p>Элизабет еще продолжала лихорадочно размышлять о случившемся, когда шум подъехавшего экипажа напомнил ей, что ее может увидеть Шарлотта, и заставил поскорее уйти в свою комнату.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА XII</p>
</div>
<p>На следующее утро Элизабет проснулась с теми же мыслями и чувствами, с которыми лишь поздней ночью сомкнула глаза. По-прежнему она не могла оправиться от изумления. Думать о чем-то другом было совершенно невозможно. Неспособная взяться за какое-нибудь дело, она сразу после завтрака решила пойти на прогулку. Дойдя было до своей любимой аллеи и вспомнив, что мистер Дарси иногда заставал ее там, она резко остановилась и, вместо того чтобы войти в парк, повернула на окаймлявшую парк тропинку, которая увела ее в сторону от проезжей дороги. Вскоре Элизабет миновала одну из боковых калиток в ограде парка.</p>
<p>Она несколько раз прошлась по тропинке туда и обратно и, очарованная прекрасным утром, остановилась у калитки, заглянув в парк. За пять недель, проведенных ею в Кенте, в природе совершилось немало изменений, и теперь с каждым днем все пышнее раскрывалась молодая листва на рано зазеленевших деревьях. Она хотела было зайти в парк поглубже, как вдруг заметила человека в прилегавшей к ограде группе деревьев. Он шел по направлению к ней. Боясь, как бы это не оказался мистер Дарси, она быстро пошла в противоположную сторону. Однако человек уже приблизился настолько, чтобы ее заметить, и устремился к Элизабет, назвав ее по имени. Услышав оклик у себя за спиной, Элизабет, хоть и узнала голос мистера Дарси, ускорила шаги по направлению к калитке. Мистер Дарси подошел туда одновременно с ней и, протянув ей письмо, которое она машинально взяла, произнес надменно-спокойным тоном:</p>
<p>— Я давно брожу по парку в надежде встретиться с вами. Не окажете ли вы мне честь, прочитав это письмо?</p>
<p>Сказав это, он слегка поклонился, повернул в глубину парка и скоро исчез за деревьями.</p>
<p>Одолеваемая любопытством, хотя и не ожидая от письма ничего приятного, Элизабет развернула пакет и, к еще большему удивлению, увидела, что письмо написано убористым почерком на двух листах почтовой бумаги. Целиком была исписана даже оборотная сторона листа, служившего конвертом. Продолжая медленно идти по аллее, она начала читать. Письмо было написано в Розингсе в 8 часов утра и заключало в себе следующее:</p>
<p>«Сударыня, получив это письмо, не тревожьтесь, — оно не содержит ни повторного выражения тех чувств, ни возобновления тех предложений, которые вызвали у Вас вчера столь сильное неудовольствие. Я пишу, не желая ни в малейшей степени задеть Вас или унизить самого себя упоминанием о намерениях, которые ради Вашего, да и моего, спокойствия должны быть забыты возможно скорее. Усилий, необходимых для написания и прочтения этого письма, можно было избежать, если бы не особенности моего характера, которые требовали, чтобы письмо все же было написано и прочтено. Вы должны поэтому простить мне вольность, с которой я прошу Вас уделить мне некоторое внимание. Я знаю, Ваши чувства будут восставать против этого, но я возлагаю надежды на Вашу справедливость.</p>
<p>Вы предъявили мне вчера два совершенно разного свойства и несопоставимых по тяжести обвинения. Первое заключалось в том, что я, не посчитавшись с чувствами мисс Беннет и мистера Бингли, разлучил двух влюбленных, а второе — что, вопреки лежавшим на мне обязательствам, долгу чести и человечности, я подорвал благосостояние мистера Уикхема и уничтожил его надежды на будущее. Намеренно и бесцеремонно пренебречь другом юности, признанным любимцем отца, молодым человеком, для которого единственным источником существования должен был стать церковный приход в моих владениях и который вырос с мыслью, что этот приход предназначен для него одного, было бы преступлением, по сравнению с которым разлучить двух молодых людей после нескольких недель взаимной симпатии представлялось бы сущей безделицей. Надеюсь, что, прочитав нижеследующее объяснение моих действий и их мотивов и учтя все обстоятельства, Вы в будущем не станете осуждать меня так сурово, как Вы это с легкостью сделали вчера вечером. Возможно, при изложении моих поступков мне придется, не щадя Ваших чувств, высказать собственные взгляды, за которые заранее прошу Вас меня простить. Я подчиняюсь необходимости, а потому дальнейшие сожаления по этому поводу лишены смысла.</p>
<p>Вскоре после нашего приезда в Хартфордшир я, как и многие другие, стал замечать, что Бингли предпочитает Вашу сестру всем молодым женщинам в местном обществе. Однако до самого бала в Незерфилде мне не приходило в голову, что между ними может возникнуть серьезная привязанность. Мой друг и прежде влюблялся у меня на глазах. И только на этом балу, когда я имел честь танцевать с Вами, я из случайного замечания сэра Уильяма Лукаса впервые понял, что склонность Бингли к мисс Беннет породила всеобщие надежды на брак между ними. Сэр Уильям говорил об этом, как о решенном деле, — нужно было, казалось, только назначить день свадьбы. С этой минуты я стал присматриваться к поведению моего друга. Только тогда я обнаружил, что его чувство к мисс Беннет намного превосходит все его прежние увлечения. Не менее внимательно я наблюдал за Вашей сестрой. Ее манеры и поведение казались, как всегда, приветливыми, веселыми и непосредственными и не давали ни малейшего повода думать, что ее сердце задето сколько-нибудь серьезно. Приглядываясь к ней в течение всего вечера, я пришел к выводу, что мисс Беннет охотно принимает ухаживания мистера Бингли, но сама не питает к нему глубокого чувства. Коль скоро Ваши сведения говорят о другом, по-видимому, я ошибся. Вы знаете Вашу сестру лучше, и поэтому так оно, вероятно, и есть. Вследствие моего ошибочного вывода я нанес Вашей сестре душевную рану, и Ваше негодование представляется вполне обоснованным. Но я не хочу упустить возможность отчасти оправдаться, заметив, что Ваша сестра удивительно хорошо владела собой и своим безмятежным видом позволяла самому проницательному наблюдателю считать, что, несмотря на мягкость характера, она обладает достаточно защищенным сердцем. Разумеется, мне хотелось прийти к заключению о ее безразличии к мистеру Бингли. Но смею утверждать, что мои наблюдения и выводы не часто зависят от моих желаний и опасений. И я решил, что сердце ее свободно, вовсе не потому, что меня это больше устраивало. Такой вывод я сделал с беспристрастностью столь же искренней, каким было мое желание, чтобы он подтвердился. Доводы против предполагавшегося брака не ограничивались теми, которые я привел Вам вчера, говоря о страсти, преодолевшей их, когда дело коснулось меня самого. Неравенство происхождения для моего друга играло меньшую роль, чем для меня. Однако существовали и другие препятствия. Эти препятствия существуют и поныне. Они в равной степени относятся ко мне и к моему другу, но я на них попытался закрыть глаза, пользуясь тем, что в последнее время они не привлекали моего внимания. Об этих препятствиях я все же должен вкратце упомянуть. Низкое общественное положение Вашей родни с материнской стороны значит весьма немного по сравнению с полным отсутствием такта, столь часто обнаруживаемым миссис Беннет и Вашими тремя младшими сестрами, а по временам даже Вашим отцом. Простите меня, мне тяжело наносить Вам еще одну обиду. Но, сожалея о слабостях Ваших близких и негодуя на меня за то, что я говорю о них в этом письме, постарайтесь утешить себя мыслью, что Вы сами, так же как Ваша старшая сестра, не заслуживаете ни малейшего упрека в том же роде и своим поведением постоянно свидетельствуете о присущем Вам вкусе и уме. Остается добавить, что все происшедшее в этот вечер в Незерфилде позволило мне составить окончательное мнение о присутствовавших и побудило меня гораздо горячее, чем я готов был к этому прежде, предостеречь моего друга против столь неудачной, с моей точки зрения, женитьбы. На следующий день он уехал из Незерфилда в Лондон, с тем чтобы, как Вы, несомненно, помните, вскоре вернуться.</p>
<p>Сейчас я должен Вам рассказать о моей роли в этой истории. Его сестры были встревожены так же сильно, как и я. Совпадение наших взглядов выяснилось достаточно быстро. И в равной степени убежденные, что необходимость повлиять на мистера Бингли требует от нас безотлагательных действий, мы вскоре решили последовать за ним в Лондон. Мы переехали в город, и там я постарался открыть своему другу глаза на все отрицательные стороны сделанного им выбора. Я обрисовал и подчеркнул их со всей серьезностью. Но хотя мои настояния и могли несколько пошатнуть его решимость и на какое-то время задержать осуществление его первоначальных намерений, я все же не думаю, чтобы они в конце концов предотвратили его женитьбу, если бы вслед за тем, — я решился на это без колебаний, — я не убедил Бингли в безразличии к нему Вашей сестры. Перед тем он был уверен, что она отвечает ему искренним чувством, хоть и не равным его собственному. Но мой друг обладает природной скромностью и доверяет моим суждениям больше, чем своим. Доказать ему, что он обманывается, было поэтому нетрудно. А как только он с этим согласился, убедить его не возвращаться в Хартфордшир стало делом одной минуты. Я не могу осуждать себя за все, что было мною совершено до этого времени. В этой истории я вспоминаю с неудовольствием лишь об одном своем поступке. Чтобы скрыть от Бингли приезд в Лондон мисс Беннет, пришлось пойти на некоторую хитрость. О ее приезде знали я и мисс Бингли. Сам он до сих пор не имеет об этом ни малейшего представления. Возможно, они могли бы встретиться без нежелательных последствий. Однако я боялся, что Бингли еще недостаточно преодолел свое чувство и что оно вспыхнет в нем с новой силой, если он снова ее увидит. Быть может, мне не следовало участвовать в этом обмане. Но дело сделано, притом из лучших побуждений. Я сказал по этому поводу все, и мне нечего добавить в свое оправдание. Если я и причинил боль Вашей сестре, я допустил это не намеренно. И если мотивы, которыми я руководствовался, не покажутся Вам убедительными, я не вижу, почему я должен был их отвергнуть.</p>
<p>По поводу второго, более тяжкого обвинения, — в нанесении ущерба мистеру Уикхему, — я могу оправдаться, лишь рассказав Вам о его связях с нашей семьей. В чем <em>именно</em> он меня обвиняет, мне неизвестно. Но достоверность того, что я Вам сейчас сообщу, может быть подтверждена не одним свидетелем, в правдивости которых нельзя усомниться.</p>
<p>Мистер Уикхем — сын уважаемого человека, который в течение многих лет управлял хозяйством поместья Пемберли и чье превосходное поведение при выполнении этих обязанностей, естественно, побудило моего отца позаботиться о вознаграждении. Свою доброту он обратил на Джорджа Уикхема, который приходился ему крестником. Мой отец оплачивал его обучение сперва в школе, а затем в Кембридже. Помощь эта была особенно существенной, так как Уикхем-старший, прозябавший в нужде из-за расточительности своей жены, был не в состоянии вырастить сына образованным человеком. Мистер Дарси не только любил общество юноши, манеры которого всегда были подкупающими, но имел о нем самое высокое мнение и, надеясь, что он изберет духовную карьеру, хотел помочь его продвижению на этом поприще. Что касается меня самого, то прошло уже немало лет с тех пор, как я начал смотреть на него другими глазами. Порочные наклонности и отсутствие чувства долга, которые он всячески скрывал даже от лучших друзей, не могли ускользнуть от взора человека почти одинакового с ним возраста, к тому же имевшего, в отличие от моего отца, возможность наблюдать за Уикхемом-младшим в минуты, когда тот становился самим собой. Сейчас я вынужден снова причинить Вам боль — не мне судить, насколько сильную. Но какими бы ни были чувства, которые Вы питаете к мистеру Уикхему, предположение об их характере не помешает мне раскрыть перед Вами его настоящий облик — напротив, оно еще больше меня к этому побуждает. Мой незабвенный отец скончался около пяти лет тому назад. Его привязанность к мистеру Уикхему оставалась до самого конца настолько сильной, что в своем завещании он особо уполномочивал меня позаботиться о будущем молодого человека, создав ему самые благоприятные условия на избранном им жизненном пути и предоставив ему, в случае если он станет священником, подходящий церковный приход сразу же, как только этот приход освободится. Кроме того, ему была завещана тысяча фунтов. Отец юноши не надолго пережил моего. Через полгода мистер Уикхем написал мне о своем твердом решении отказаться от священнического сана. При этом он предполагал, что мне не покажется необоснованной его надежда получить компенсацию взамен ожидавшейся им привилегии, которую он тем самым утрачивал. По его словам, он возымел желание изучить юриспруденцию, а я, конечно, не мог не понять, что тысячи фунтов для этого недостаточно. Мне очень хотелось поверить искренности его намерений, хотя я не могу сказать, что это мне вполне удалось. Тем не менее я сразу согласился с его предложением, так как отлично понимал, насколько мистер Уикхем не подходит для роли священника. Дело, таким образом, быстро уладилось: он отказывался от всякой помощи в духовной карьере, — даже в том случае, если бы в будущем у него возникла возможность такую помощь принять, — и получал взамен три тысячи фунтов. На этом, казалось бы, всякая связь между нами прерывалась. Я был о нем слишком плохого мнения, чтобы приглашать его в Пемберли или искать его общества в столице. Насколько я могу предполагать, он жил главным образом в Лондоне, однако изучение юриспруденции так и осталось для него только предлогом. Ничем более не сдерживаемый, он повел жизнь праздную и разгульную. На протяжении трех лет я почти ничего о нем не слышал. Но когда священник в ранее предназначавшемся для него приходе скончался, он написал мне письмо с просьбой оставить этот приход за ним. Как он сообщал, — и этому нетрудно было поверить, — он находился в самых стесненных обстоятельствах. Изучение юриспруденции ничего ему не дало, и, по его словам, он теперь твердо решил принять духовный сан, если я предоставлю ему приход — в последнем он нисколько не сомневался, так как хорошо знал, что мне не о ком больше заботиться и что я не мог забыть волю моего досточтимого родителя. Едва ли вы осудите меня за то, что я не выполнил его просьбы, так же как отверг все позднейшие подобные притязания. Его негодование было под стать его бедственному положению, и он нимало не стеснялся поносить меня перед окружающими, так же как выражать свои упреки мне самому. С этого времени всякое знакомство между нами было прекращено. Как протекала его жизнь — мне неизвестно. Но прошлым летом он снова неприятнейшим образом напомнил мне о своем существовании.</p>
<p>Здесь я должен коснуться обстоятельства, которое мне бы хотелось изгладить из собственной памяти. Лишь очень серьезный повод, побудивший меня написать Вам это письмо, служит причиной того, что я решился кому-то о нем поведать. Сказав это, я не сомневаюсь, что Вы навсегда сохраните его в тайне. Опека над моей сестрой, которая моложе меня на десять лет, была разделена между мною и племянником моей матери, полковником Фицуильямом. Около года назад мы забрали сестру из школы и устроили ее сперва в Лондоне, а прошлым летом — вместе с присматривавшей за ней дамой — в Рэмсгейте<a href="#ref18" class="a" onclick="save();">[22]</a>. Там же, несомненно, со злым умыслом, поселился и мистер Уикхем. Ибо, как впоследствии обнаружилось, миссис Янг, в характере которой мы жестоко обманулись, знала его еще в давние времена. При попустительстве этой дамы ему удалось настолько расположить к себе Джорджиану, в нежном сердце которой сохранилась привязанность к нему, возникшая в ее детские годы, что она вообразила себя влюбленной и согласилась совершить с ним побег. В ту пору ей было всего пятнадцать лет — это может ей служить оправданием. Признав ее легкомыслие, я счастлив добавить, что сведениями о готовившемся побеге обязан ей самой. Я приехал к ней неожиданно за день или за два до назначенного срока, и тогда Джорджиана, будучи не в силах огорчить и оскорбить брата, на которого смотрела почти как на отца, во всем мне призналась. Что я при этом пережил и как поступил, вы легко можете себе представить. Забота о чувствах и добром имени сестры не допускала открытого разоблачения. Но я сразу написал мистеру Уикхему, который незамедлительно покинул эти места. И, разумеется, я отказался от дальнейших услуг миссис Янг. Мистера Уикхема, несомненно, прежде всего интересовало приданое сестры, равное тридцати тысячам фунтов. Однако я не могу избавиться от мысли, что его сильно соблазняла также возможность выместить на мне свою злобу. Он отомстил бы мне, в самом деле, с лихвой. Такова, сударыня, правдивая история всех отношений, связывающих нас с этим человеком. И если Вы хоть немного ей поверите, надеюсь, с этих пор Вы не будете меня обвинять в жестокости к мистеру Уикхему. Мне неизвестно, с помощью какого обмана он приобрел Ваше расположение, но, быть может, его успеху не следует удивляться. Не имея никаких сведений о каждом из нас, Вы не могли уличить его во лжи, а подозрительность — не в Вашей натуре.</p>
<p>Вам, пожалуй, покажется странным, что я не рассказал всего этого вчера вечером. Но в ту минуту я не настолько владел собой, чтобы решить — вправе ли я и должен ли раскрыть перед Вами все здесь изложенное. Достоверность моих слов может Вам подтвердить полковник Фицуильям. Наше родство и полная взаимная откровенность, а тем более наша совместная опека над Джорджианой неизбежно вводили его в курс всех событий. Если неприязнь ко мне обесценивает в Ваших глазах всякое мое слово, подобная причина не помешает Вам поверить моему кузену. И для того, чтобы Вы имели возможность его расспросить, я попытаюсь найти способ передать Вам это письмо в течение сегодняшнего утра. Я добавляю к этому только: да благословит Вас Господь!</p>
<p>Фицуильям Дарси»</p>

<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XIII</p>
</div>
<p>Хотя Элизабет, взяв письмо у мистера Дарси, вовсе не думала, что в этом письме он опять попросит ее руки, ей все же не приходило в голову, о чем он еще мог бы ей написать. Поэтому нетрудно понять, с какой жадностью прочла она заключенные в нем объяснения и какие противоречивые отклики вызвали они в ее душе. Ее чувствам в эти минуты едва ли можно было найти точное определение. С изумлением отметила она для себя вначале, что Дарси надеется как-то оправдаться в своих поступках. И она не сомневалась, что у него не могло быть истинных мотивов, в которых не постыдился бы сознаться любой порядочный человек. С сильнейшим предубеждением против всего, что он мог бы сказать, приступила она к его рассказу о том, что произошло в Незерфилде. Торопливость, с которой она проглатывала строку за строкой, едва ли позволяла ей вникнуть в смысл того, что она уже успела прочесть, и от нетерпения узнать, что содержится в следующей фразе, она была неспособна как следует понять предыдущую. Прежде всего ей показалось фальшивым утверждение Дарси, что он не заметил в Джейн серьезного ответного чувства по отношению к Бингли. Перечень вполне реальных и серьезных возражений против предполагавшейся партии возмутил ее настолько сильно, что она уже была не в состоянии справедливо оценивать его слова. Он не жалел о случившемся в той мере, какой она была вправе от него требовать. Его слова выражали не раскаяние, а самодовольство. Все письмо было лишь проявлением высокомерия и гордости.</p>
<p>Но чувства ее пришли в еще большее расстройство и стали более мучительными, когда от этого рассказа она перешла к истории мистера Уикхема. С несколько более ясной головой она прочла о событиях, которые, если только их описание было правдивым, совершенно опрокидывали всякое доброе суждение об этом молодом человеке — и в то же время это описание удивительно напоминало историю, изложенную самим Уикхемом. Изумление, негодование, даже ужас охватили ее. Беспрестанно повторяя: «Это неправда! Не может этого быть! Гнусная ложь!» — она пыталась отвергнуть все, с начала до конца. Пробежав глазами письмо и едва осознав содержание одной или двух последних страниц, она поспешно сложила листки, стараясь уверить себя, что ей нечего обращать на него внимание и что она больше никогда в него не заглянет.</p>
<p>В душевном смятении, неспособная сосредоточиться, она попробовала немного пройтись. Но это не помогло. Через полминуты она снова развернула письмо и, стараясь взять себя в руки, перечитала ту его часть, в которой разоблачалось поведение Уикхема. Ей удалось настолько овладеть собой, что она смогла вникнуть в смысл каждой фразы. Сведения об отношениях Уикхема с семьей Дарси полностью соответствовали словам Уикхема. В обеих версиях также совпадали упоминания о щедрости покойного мистера Дарси, хотя раньше Элизабет не знала, в чем она проявлялась. До сих пор один рассказ только дополнялся другим. Но когда она прочла про завещание, различие между ними стало разительным. Она хорошо запомнила слова Уикхема о завещанном ему приходе и, восстановив их в памяти, не могла не понять, что одна из двух версий содержит грубый обман. В первые минуты Элизабет еще надеялась, что чутье подсказало ей правильный выбор. Но, перечитав несколько раз самым внимательным образом то место, где подробно рассказывалось о безоговорочном отказе Уикхема от прихода и о полученном им значительном возмещении в сумме трех тысяч фунтов, она начала колебаться. Не глядя на письмо и стараясь быть беспристрастной, она взвесила правдоподобность каждого обстоятельства, но это не помогло. С обеих сторон были одни голословные утверждения. Она снова принялась за чтение. И с каждой строчкой ей становилось все яснее, что история, в которой, как ей думалось прежде, поведение мистера Дарси не могло быть названо иначе чем бесчестное, могла вдруг обернуться таким образом, что оно оказалось бы вполне безупречным.</p>
<p>Обвинение Уикхема в расточительности и распущенности поразило ее сильнее всего — тем более что она затруднялась найти доказательство несправедливости подобных упреков. Она ничего не слышала об Уикхеме до того, как он поступил в ***ширский полк по рекомендации случайно встретившегося с ним на улице едва знакомого молодого человека. О его прежней жизни никому из ее близких ничего не было известно, кроме того, что он сам о себе рассказывал. Да и едва ли, даже если бы Элизабет могла это сделать, ей пришло бы в голову выяснять, что он в действительности собой представляет. Его внешность, голос, манеры сразу создавали впечатление, что ему присущи все добродетели. Она попыталась восстановить в памяти какой-нибудь его благородный поступок, какую-нибудь отличительную черту, которая бы доказывала его порядочность и опровергала нападки на него мистера Дарси. Или хотя бы вспомнить о каком-либо хорошем качестве, которое показалось бы несовместимым с приписываемыми ему Дарси годами праздной и порочной жизни. Но ничего подобного припомнить она не могла. Ей было легко представить его себе во всем очаровании его манер и наружности. Но ей не удавалось восстановить в памяти ничего говорившего в его пользу, кроме всеобщего одобрения знакомых и симпатии, которую он вызывал своей внешностью. После продолжительных размышлений Элизабет снова взялась за письмо. Но, увы, следовавшее дальше описание его попытки соблазнить мисс Дарси как-то перекликалось с происшедшим накануне разговором между Элизабет и полковником Фицуильямом. И вдобавок ей предлагалось обратиться за подтверждением всех подробностей к самому полковнику, от которого она еще раньше слышала, что он полностью осведомлен о жизни мисс Дарси, и порядочность которого не вызывала сомнений. В какой-то момент она и вправду вознамерилась расспросить его, но ее остановила мысль о щекотливости темы, которую нужно было затронуть, и она окончательно от этого отказалась, сообразив, что мистер Дарси едва ли рискнул бы сослаться на кузена, не будучи вполне уверен в его поддержке.</p>
<p>Она прекрасно помнила все подробности своего разговора с Уикхемом во время их первой встречи в доме у мистера Филипса. Многие его выражения были еще свежи в ее памяти. И Элизабет внезапно осознала, насколько неуместно было со стороны Уикхема рассказывать о подобных вещах ей — едва знакомому тогда для него человеку, и удивилась, что эта простая мысль прежде не приходила ей в голову. Она ясно увидела, как неприлично вел себя Уикхем, стараясь всюду обратить на себя внимание. Его утверждения не согласовались с его поступками. Ей припомнилось, как он хвастался, что ему нечего бояться встречи с мистером Дарси и что пусть-де мистер Дарси сам покинет эти места, а он и не подумает уезжать. И, вместе с тем, он не посмел явиться на бал в Незерфилде всего через неделю после этого разговора! Она вспомнила, что до отъезда незерфилдской компании из Хартфордшира он не рассказывал своей истории никому, кроме нее. Зато после их отъезда эту историю узнали решительно все. Стремясь опорочить мистера Дарси, он не брезговал ничем. И в то же время, говоря ей о своей преданности памяти Дарси-отца, утверждал, что эта преданность не позволяет ему плохо говорить о сыне своего благодетеля.</p>
<p>Как изменился теперь в ее глазах каждый поступок мистера Уикхема! Ухаживание за мисс Кинг объяснялось не чем иным, как его низкой расчетливостью, — незначительность ее приданого вовсе не говорила об умеренности его притязаний, а только о готовности прельститься любой приманкой. Его отношение к самой Элизабет уже не оправдывалось достойными мотивами: он либо заблуждался относительно ее средств, либо тешил свое тщеславие, поддерживая в ней склонность, которую она, по ее мнению, неосторожно обнаружила. Попытки Элизабет защитить Уикхема становились слабее и слабее. А по мере оправдания мистера Дарси она не могла не припомнить, что Бингли еще давно, в ответ на заданный ему Джейн вопрос, выразил уверенность в безукоризненном поведении своего друга в отношении Уикхема; что, несмотря на свои высокомерные и отталкивающие манеры, на протяжении всего их знакомства, которое в последнее время так их сблизило, открыв ей его сокровеннейшие тайны, Дарси ни разу не совершил поступка, который позволил бы обвинить его в несправедливости и недобросовестности или говорил бы о его порочных наклонностях; что среди круга своих знакомых он пользовался всеобщим почетом и уважением; что даже Уикхем отзывался о нем как о самом преданном брате и что ей не раз приходилось слышать, с какой любовью Дарси говорил о своей сестре, доказывая тем самым свою способность испытывать нежные чувства; что приписываемая ему Уикхемом постыдная несправедливость едва ли могла долго оставаться неразоблаченной; и что, наконец, дружба между человеком, который мог бы на это решиться, с таким славным юношей, как мистер Бингли, представлялась просто невероятной.</p>
<p>Ей стало бесконечно стыдно за свое поведение. Она не могла думать о Дарси или об Уикхеме, не отдавая себе отчета в своей слепоте, предубежденности, несправедливости, глупости.</p>
<p>— Как позорно я поступила! — воскликнула она. — Я, так гордившаяся своей проницательностью и так полагавшаяся на собственный здравый смысл! Так часто смеявшаяся над доброжелательством моей сестры и питавшая свое тщеславие столь постыдной и неоправданной неприязнью! Как унижает меня это открытие! И как справедливо я унижена! Если бы я даже влюбилась, я и тогда не оказалась бы столь слепой. Но тщеславие, а не любовь лишили меня зрения! Польщенная при первом знакомстве предпочтением одного человека и оскорбленная пренебрежением другого, я руководствовалась предрассудками и невежеством и гнала от себя разумные доводы, как только дело касалось любого из них! Вот когда мне довелось в себе разобраться!</p>
<p>По мере того как она переходила в мыслях от себя к Джейн и от Джейн к Бингли, ей должно было прийти в голову, что в этой части объяснения Дарси представлялись совершенно неубедительными. Она прочла их опять. Теперь они показались ей совсем не такими, как после первого чтения. Признавая основательность рассуждений Дарси в одной части письма, могла ли она отвергнуть ее в другой? По его словам, он даже не подозревал, насколько сильно Джейн была влюблена в его друга. И она не могла не вспомнить, какого мнения по этому поводу придерживалась Шарлотта, так же как не могла отрицать, что описанное им поведение Джейн соответствовало действительности. Она и вправду сознавала, что чувство Джейн, каким бы оно ни было глубоким на самом деле, внешне было мало заметно и что свойственные сестре самообладание и уравновешенность не часто сочетаются с сильными душевными порывами.</p>
<p>Когда она дошла до того места, где сурово и вместе с тем заслуженно осуждались недостатки ее родных, переживаемое ею чувство стыда стало еще острее. Она слишком хорошо понимала справедливость высказанных в письме упреков, чтобы пытаться их опровергнуть. Все подробности незерфилдского бала, о которых упоминал Дарси и которые укрепили в нем неблагоприятное отношение к предполагавшемуся браку, едва ли сохранились в ее памяти слабее, чем в его собственной.</p>
<p>Комплимент по адресу двух старших мисс Беннет не прошел незамеченным. Он смягчил, но не утолил боль, вызванную недостойным поведением остальных членов семьи. Ей стало очевидно, что сердце Джейн разбито стараниями ее родни, и, представив себе весь ущерб во мнении света, который наносился ей и ее сестре поведением их близких родственников, Элизабет почувствовала себя такой несчастной, какой не бывала никогда в жизни.</p>
<p>Она бродила по тропинке еще около двух часов, вновь и вновь возвращаясь к волновавшим ее мыслям, перебирая события, оценивая их значение и стараясь привыкнуть к столь резкой и неожиданной перемене собственных взглядов. Наконец усталость и сознание того, что ее отсутствие затянулось слишком надолго, заставили ее направиться к Хансфорду. Она вошла в дом, стараясь принять обычный веселый вид и выбросить из головы все, что мешало бы ей участвовать в домашних беседах.</p>
<p>Сразу по приходе ей сообщили, что оба джентльмена из Розингса, один за другим, навестили пасторский домик во время ее отсутствия. Мистер Дарси зашел только на несколько минут попрощаться. Зато полковник Фицуильям просидел не меньше часа, надеясь дождаться ее возвращения, и чуть было не отправился разыскивать ее в парке. Элизабет могла только изобразить сожаление по поводу того, что ей не удалось его повидать, — на самом же деле она этому даже радовалась. Полковник Фицуильям перестал для нее существовать. Она способна была думать лишь о полученном письме.</p>
<p></span><span id="id39"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XIV</p>
</div>
<p>Оба джентльмена уехали из Розингса на следующее утро. Мистер Коллинз, поджидавший их у калитки, дабы отвесить им прощальный поклон, явился в дом с радостной вестью об их добром здоровье, а также настолько хорошем расположении духа, насколько это было возможно после недавней печальной разлуки, и устремился в Розингс, чтобы утешить леди Кэтрин и мисс де Бёр. По возвращении он с большим удовольствием сообщил, что, по словам ее светлости, она страдает от невыносимой скуки и очень желала бы видеть их сегодня же у себя за обедом.</p>
<p>Глядя на леди Кэтрин, Элизабет не могла не подумать, что при желании она была бы сейчас представлена ее светлости в качестве будущей племянницы. И когда она вообразила, как бы при этом разгневалась столь важная особа, ей было трудно удержаться от улыбки. «Интересно, что бы она сейчас говорила и как бы себя вела?» — развлекала себя подобными вопросами Элизабет.</p>
<p>Разговор с самого начала коснулся отъезда из Розингса племянников леди Кэтрин.</p>
<p>— Поверьте, — говорила она, — их отъезд глубоко разбередил мою душу. Едва ли кто-нибудь переживает разлуку с друзьями так глубоко. А к этим молодым людям я питаю особую склонность. И они столь же привязаны ко мне! Если бы вы знали, с какой грустью покидали они мой дом! Так бывает с ними всегда. Бедный полковник сдерживал свои чувства до последней минуты, но Дарси переживал разлуку, пожалуй, тяжелее, чем в прошлом году. Его привязанность к Розингсу стала еще сильнее.</p>
<p>На этот случай у мистера Коллинза был припасен комплимент, содержавший известный намек, который мать и дочь встретили одобрительными улыбками.</p>
<p>После обеда леди Кэтрин заметила, что мисс Беннет слегка расстроена, и тут же объяснила это ее нежеланием в скором времени возвращаться домой.</p>
<p>— Но если дело лишь в этом, вы должны попросить у вашей матушки разрешения задержаться чуть-чуть подольше. Миссис Коллинз, я уверена, будет рада вашему обществу.</p>
<p>— Я очень благодарна вашей светлости за столь любезное приглашение, — ответила Элизабет. — Но, к сожалению, мне невозможно его принять. В следующую субботу я должна уже быть в Лондоне.</p>
<p>— Но тогда ваше пребывание в Кенте продлится всего-навсего шесть недель! Я была уверена, что вы проживете два месяца. Миссис Коллинз слышала это от меня еще перед вашим приездом. Вам нет нужды возвращаться так скоро. Надеюсь, миссис Беннет обойдется две недели без вас.</p>
<p>— Да, но без меня не сможет обойтись мой отец. На днях он просил меня поторопиться с приездом.</p>
<p>— Ну, отцу-то вы наверняка не очень нужны, коли вы не нужны вашей матери. Дочери всегда мало значат для отцов. А если вы задержитесь на месяц, мне бы ничего не стоило одну из вас довезти до самого Лондона — я собираюсь туда на неделю в начале июня. Так как Доусон ничего не имеет против четырехместной коляски, у меня будет место для одной из девиц. А если погода будет не жаркой, я согласилась бы даже взять обеих — вы ведь такие худенькие.</p>
<p>— Вы необыкновенно добры, ваша светлость. Но боюсь, нам придется придерживаться нашего первоначального плана.</p>
<p>Леди Кэтрин, по-видимому, решила уступить.</p>
<p>— Миссис Коллинз, вам придется послать с ними слугу. Вы знаете, я всегда высказываю свое мнение прямо. Я не могу допустить, чтобы девицы путешествовали на почтовых лошадях<a href="#ref17" class="a" onclick="save();">[23]</a>, предоставленные самим себе, — это попросту неприлично! Вы должны кого-нибудь найти, — больше всего на свете я не терплю подобных вещей. Молодые женщины, сообразно их положению в обществе, всегда требуют надлежащего внимания и надзора. Когда моя племянница Джорджиана прошлым летом переезжала в Рэмсгейт, я потребовала, чтобы с нею поехали два человека. Для мисс Дарси, дочери мистера Дарси из Пемберли и леди Энн, появиться без них было бы невозможно. Во всех подобных вопросах я весьма щепетильна. Вам следует послать Джона с юными леди, миссис Коллинз. И я очень рада, что мне пришло в голову об этом упомянуть, — вы поступили бы опрометчиво, отпустив их одних.</p>
<p>— Мой дядя должен прислать за нами слугу.</p>
<p>— Ах, вот как, ваш дядя? Он держит слугу — мужчину, не так ли? Я рада, что у вас есть хоть кто-нибудь, кто может подумать об этих вещах. А где вы будете менять лошадей? Разумеется, в Бромли. Вам достаточно назвать мое имя в «Колоколе», и о вас непременно позаботятся.</p>
<p>У леди Кэтрин было еще немало замечаний по поводу их поездки, и, так как не на все свои вопросы отвечала она сама, к ним все же приходилось прислушиваться. Элизабет могла этому только радоваться, ибо в любую минуту была способна погрузиться в собственные мысли и забыть, где она находится. Мысли эти следовало отложить до свободного времени — в одиночестве она была готова отдаться им целиком. И она ежедневно отправлялась одна на прогулку, в течение которой получала полную возможность предаваться своим печальным раздумьям.</p>
<p>Письмо мистера Дарси она выучила почти наизусть. Элизабет обдумала в нем каждую фразу, и ее чувства по отношению к автору в разные моменты были самыми противоречивыми. Когда она припоминала тон, которым он говорил, предлагая ей руку, душа ее по-прежнему была полна негодования, но при мысли о том, как грубо и несправедливо она его обвинила и оттолкнула, весь ее гнев сосредоточивался на ней самой, а его обманутые надежды находили отклик в ее сердце. Его привязанность заслуживала благодарности, а характер — уважения. И все же он был ей по-прежнему неприятен, — она ни минуты не жалела о своем отказе и вовсе не испытывала желания еще раз его увидеть. Собственное ее прежнее поведение служило для Элизабет постоянным поводом для недовольства собой. Еще большую муку вызывали в ней мысли о слабостях ее близких. Не было даже надежды, что они когда-нибудь будут преодолены. Отец, которому доставляло удовольствие смеяться над младшими дочками, никогда не возьмет на себя труд обуздать их легкомыслие. А ее матери, собственные манеры которой были далеки от совершенства, даже и в голову не приходило, что с младшими дочками не все обстоит благополучно. Элизабет и Джейн нередко пытались хотя бы немного образумить Кэтрин и Лидию. Но разве они могли надеяться на успех, не встречая поддержки со стороны миссис Беннет? Раздражительная и слабохарактерная Кэтрин, полностью находившаяся под влиянием младшей сестры, в ответ на замечания Джейн и Элизабет лишь обижалась. А своевольная и беззаботная Лидия вообще не обращала на них внимания. Обе младшие сестры были невежественны, ленивы и тщеславны. Было ясно, что они не перестанут кокетничать, пока в Меритоне останется хоть один офицер, а так как прогулка из Лонгборна в Меритон не составляла труда, им предстояло бегать туда до скончания века.</p>
<p>Другим источником ее постоянных огорчений были мысли о Джейн. Письмо мистера Дарси восстановило первоначальное доброе мнение Элизабет о Бингли и усилило значение утраты, понесенной ее сестрой. Его привязанность оказалась глубокой, а упреки его поведению — необоснованными, если только не считать недостатком слепое доверие к другу. Как грустно было сознавать, что столь прекрасная партия, благоприятная во всех отношениях и обещавшая такую счастливую жизнь ее сестре, расстроилась из-за глупости и бестактности ее ближайших родственников!</p>
<p>Если ко всем этим обстоятельствам добавить разоблачение подлинного облика Уикхема, нетрудно понять, что, вопреки обычно присущей ей жизнерадостности, она чувствовала себя угнетенной и с трудом могла сохранить на лице сколько-нибудь веселое выражение.</p>
<p>На протяжении последней недели пребывания у Коллинзов они навещали Розингс столь же часто, как в первую неделю после прибытия в Хансфорд. Самый последний вечер перед отъездом они тоже провели в гостях у леди Кэтрин. В течение этого вечера ее светлость осведомилась решительно обо всех мелочах, связанных с их путешествием, растолковала, как им лучше всего упаковать свои вещи, и с такой решительностью потребовала, чтобы платья были уложены по ее, единственно правильному, способу, что Мария сочла себя обязанной по возвращении переделать все сделанное утром и уложить свой сундучок заново.</p>
<p>На прощанье леди Кэтрин весьма снисходительно пожелала им счастливого пути, пригласив навестить Хансфорд следующей весной, а мисс де Бёр дала себе труд сделать книксен и каждой из них протянуть руку.</p>
<p></span><span id="id40"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XV</p>
</div>
<p>В субботу утром мистер Коллинз, встретив Элизабет за несколько минут до того, как все собрались к завтраку, воспользовался случаем, чтобы рассыпаться перед ней в совершенно обязательных, на его взгляд, прощальных любезностях.</p>
<p>— Я, мисс Элизабет, не знаю, — сказал он, — говорила ли вам уже миссис Коллинз, насколько она была тронута вашей готовностью нас навестить. Но я убежден, что вы не покинете этот дом, не выслушав подобающих выражений ее признательности. Вашим обществом, смею вас уверить, здесь необыкновенно дорожили. Мы, конечно, сознаем, сколь мало привлекательного можно найти в этом скромном обиталище. Простой образ жизни, небольшие комнаты, немногочисленная прислуга и ограниченный круг знакомств делают Хансфорд крайне скучным местом для юной особы вашего склада. Но вы, я надеюсь, поверите, что мы очень высоко оценили вашу снисходительность и попытались сделать все от нас зависящее, чтобы жизнь в этом доме не оказалась вам в тягость.</p>
<p>Элизабет поблагодарила его, сказав, что очень довольна пребыванием в Хансфорде. Эти шесть недель доставили ей много радости. Удовольствие, которое она испытывала, находясь в обществе Шарлотты, так же как и оказанное ей большое внимание, заставляют, напротив, именно ее чувствовать себя в долгу перед хозяевами дома. Мистер Коллинз был удовлетворен ее ответом и произнес с еще более самодовольной улыбкой:</p>
<p>— Я с величайшим удовольствием услышал, что вы провели здесь время не без приятности. Мы старались, как могли. А принимая во внимание счастливую возможность ввести вас в высшее общество благодаря нашим связям с Розингсом и тем самым столь часто оживлять однообразие домашней жизни, я льщу себя надеждой, что визит в Хансфорд и в самом деле не показался вам совершенно невыносимым. Близость к семье леди Кэтрин действительно является необыкновенно счастливым преимуществом нашего положения, равным которому могут похвастаться немногие. Вы знаете теперь, как коротко мы знакомы, и видели, сколь часто нас туда приглашают. И, по правде говоря, при всех недостатках этой скромной обители, никто, на мой взгляд, из здесь живущих и пользующихся вместе с нами благами этой близости не нуждается в сострадании.</p>
<p>Будучи не в силах выразить переполнявшие его возвышенные чувства, он стал расхаживать по комнате, в то время как Элизабет попыталась совместить искренность и учтивость в нескольких коротких ответных фразах.</p>
<p>— По приезде домой, дорогая кузина, вы сможете наилучшим образом охарактеризовать нашу жизнь. Мне бы хотелось, по крайней мере, так думать. Изо дня в день вы были свидетельницей многочисленных знаков внимания, оказанных миссис Коллинз со стороны леди Кэтрин. Я нахожу, что судьбу вашей подруги нельзя считать несчастливой… Впрочем, лучше об этом умолчим. Позвольте мне только заверить вас, дорогая мисс Элизабет, что я от всего сердца желаю и вам столь же счастливого замужества. Мы с моей дорогой Шарлоттой смотрим на все как бы одними глазами и одинаково обо всем думаем. Наши характеры и взгляды необыкновенно похожи, и мы, должно быть, созданы друг для друга.</p>
<p>Элизабет могла сказать, не кривя душой, что в таких случаях жизнь складывается очень счастливо, и с равной искренностью выразила убеждение, что мистер Коллинз доволен своим домашним очагом. Она, однако, не была огорчена, когда ее ответ прервало появление леди, которой он был обязан окружавшими его удобствами. Бедная Шарлотта! Как грустно было оставлять ее в таком обществе! Но она выбрала свою участь с открытыми глазами. И хотя Шарлотта явно была опечалена отъездом гостей, она и виду не показала, что нуждается в их сочувствии. Дом и хозяйство, церковный приход и птичник, а также все, что с этим связано, еще не утратили для нее своего очарования.</p>
<p>Карета была наконец подана, багаж — привязан снаружи, свертки — рассованы внутри, и было объявлено, что все готово к отъезду. После нежного прощания с подругой Элизабет направилась к экипажу в сопровождении мистера Коллинза, который, пока они шли по саду, попросил засвидетельствовать свое искреннее уважение ее семье вместе с благодарностью за гостеприимство, оказанное ему в Лонгборне прошедшей зимой, и поклонами, увы, незнакомым ему мистеру и миссис Гардинер. Затем он помог ей усесться в экипаж. Мария последовала за ней, и дверца уже было почти закрылась, когда мистер Коллинз внезапно с некоторым ужасом вспомнил, что отъезжающие ничего не попросили передать дамам из Розингса.</p>
<p>— Впрочем, — добавил он, — вы, разумеется, желали бы, чтобы я передал им ваше нижайшее почтение вместе с глубокой благодарностью за оказанное вам гостеприимство?</p>
<p>Элизабет не имела против этого никаких возражений, после чего дверце наконец дали захлопнуться, и карета тронулась.</p>
<p>— Боже ты мой! — воскликнула Мария после нескольких минут молчания. — Кажется, будто мы только день или два назад сюда приехали. А как много за это время произошло разных событий!</p>
<p>— В самом деле, порядочно, — со вздохом подтвердила ее спутница.</p>
<p>— Подумать только, мы девять раз обедали в Розингсе! Да еще два раза пили там чай! Сколько мне придется об этом рассказывать!</p>
<p>Элизабет добавила про себя: «И сколько мне придется скрывать!»</p>
<p>В дороге они почти все время молчали. Без всяких происшествий через четыре часа после отъезда из Хансфорда они подъехали к дому мистера Гардинера, где им предстояло провести несколько дней.</p>
<p>Джейн выглядела неплохо, а в ее душевном состоянии Элизабет не могла разобраться из-за множества развлечений, о которых позаботилась для них миссис Гардинер. Но сестры возвращались теперь вместе в Лонгборн, и там у Элизабет должно было найтись для наблюдений вполне достаточно времени.</p>
<p>Ей потребовалось некоторое усилие, чтобы сдержаться и не рассказать Джейн еще до приезда в Лонгборн о предложении мистера Дарси. Поразительная новость — столь лестная для тщеславия Элизабет, от которого ей не удавалось избавиться доводами рассудка, — настойчиво побуждала ее к откровенности. И она едва ли смогла бы с собой совладать, если бы не боялась дойти до излишних подробностей и еще больше расстроить Джейн, неосторожно упомянув о мистере Бингли.</p>
<p></span><span id="id41"></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XVI</p>
</div>
<p>Шла вторая неделя мая, когда три молодые леди, покинув Грейсчёрч-стрит, выехали в городок*** в Хартфордшире. Приближаясь к гостинице, в которой их должен был встретить экипаж мистера Беннета, они убедились в исполнительности возницы, увидев головы Китти и Лидии, выглядывающие из окна столовой во втором этаже. Две девицы премило провели в городке целый час, посетив модную лавку, поглазев на часового и приготовив салат с огурцами. После взаимных приветствий младшие сестры с торжеством показали старшим накрытый стол, уставленный обычными для гостиниц холодными закусками, восклицая при этом:</p>
<p>— Взгляните, как мило! Не правда ли, приятный сюрприз?!</p>
<p>— Мы собираемся вас угостить, — добавила Лидия, — только вы должны снабдить нас деньгами, потому что все, что у нас было, мы потратили вон в той лавке.</p>
<p>Тут она принялась показывать свои покупки.</p>
<p>— Посмотрите, какую я себе купила шляпку. Конечно, так себе. Можно было даже не покупать. Но я подумала, что с тем же успехом могу и купить. Дома я ее распорю и посмотрю, нельзя ли сделать из нее что-нибудь попригляднее.</p>
<p>Когда сестры нашли ее безобразной, она невозмутимо добавила:</p>
<p>— Там были еще две или три шляпки куда хуже, чем эта. Надо будет только прикупить яркого атласа, чтобы ее заново отделать, — тогда, мне кажется, она будет выглядеть не так плохо. А впрочем, не все ли равно, что мы станем носить летом, если полк через две недели отбудет из Меритона!</p>
<p>— Неужели он нас покидает? — воскликнула Элизабет, крайне обрадованная этим известием.</p>
<p>— Теперь они будут стоять в лагере около Брайтона. Так хочется, чтобы папа всех нас повез туда на лето! Мы бы славно там пожили, и это почти ничего бы не стоило. Мама тоже об этом мечтает. Ведь только подумайте, какая нас ждет летом скучища!</p>
<p>«В самом деле, очень удачная затея, — подумала Элизабет. — Как раз то, чего нам недоставало! Боже мой, это нам-то собраться в Брайтон с целым его военным лагерем, когда у нас все пошло вверх дном от захудалого полка милиции и меритонских балов, которые даются раз в месяц».</p>
<p>— А у меня для тебя новость, — сказала Лидия, когда все расселись вокруг стола. — Ну-ка подумай, что бы такое могло случиться, а? Отличная новость, превосходная новость — об одном человеке, который всем нам очень понравился.</p>
<p>Джейн и Элизабет переглянулись, и прислуживавшему лакею было дозволено удалиться.</p>
<p>— Очень на вас похоже! — со смехом сказала Лидия. — С вашими чинностью и благоразумием бояться, как бы лакей чего не подслушал. Будто ему есть до этого дело! Он небось часто слышит вещи еще почище того, что я расскажу. Впрочем, он такое страшилище, что я даже рада его уходу. В жизни не видела этакого длиннющего подбородка! Ну, слушайте, мои милые. Дело идет о нашем дорогом Уикхеме. Слишком хорошо для лакея, не правда ли? Так вот, Уикхем не собирается жениться на Мэри Кинг! Как вам это нравится, а? Она укатила к своему дядюшке в Ливерпуль, притом навсегда. За Уикхема можно не беспокоиться.</p>
<p>— За Мери Кинг, значит, тоже можно не беспокоиться, — сказала Элизабет. — Она избежала неразумного брака.</p>
<p>— Если он ей нравился, она поступила, как настоящая дура.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, — сказала Джейн, — они не были слишком друг другом увлечены.</p>
<p>— Он-то, конечно, не был. Уикхему, я уверена, всегда было на нее наплевать. Разве эта кукла в веснушках кому-то понадобится?</p>
<p>Элизабет с ужасом подумала, что ее собственные взгляды, недавно казавшиеся ей свободными, хотя и не выражались столь циничным языком, были не менее циничны по существу.</p>
<p>Как только барышни сообща покончили с едой, а Джейн и Элизабет за нее заплатили, они попросили подать экипаж. Разместиться в нем всей компании со всеми шкатулками, сумками и пакетами, а также не слишком своевременными новыми приобретениями Китти и Лидии оказалось не так-то легко.</p>
<p>— Ловко мы сюда втиснулись! — воскликнула Лидия. — Я особенно рада, что купила эту шляпку. Чего стоит удовольствие запихнуть еще одну лишнюю коробку! А теперь давайте устроимся поудобнее и будем всю дорогу болтать и веселиться. Ну-ка послушаем, что новенького с вами приключилось с тех пор, как вы уехали из дому. Встретились вам какие-нибудь интересные кавалеры? А пофлиртовать вам, конечно, удалось вволю? Я даже надеялась, что одной из вас удастся до возвращения выскочить замуж. Джейн скоро будет у нас старой девой, честное слово! Ей уже почти двадцать три! Если бы я до этих лет не сумела раздобыть себе мужа, я бы сгорела со стыда! Знаете, как тетке Филипс не терпится, чтобы все мы повыходили замуж? Лиззи, по ее мнению, надо было выйти за мистера Коллинза. Я, правда, не думаю, чтобы из этого вышло что-нибудь путное. Боже мой, как бы мне хотелось выйти замуж раньше вас всех! Я бы тогда стала вывозить вас на балы! Ой, девочки, а как мы позавчера повеселились у Форстеров! Они пригласили нас с Китти на целый день. А к вечеру миссис Форстер обещала, что мы сможем немного потанцевать. Кстати, мы с миссис Форстер души друг в друге не чаем! И вот она позвала обеих сестер Харрингтон. Харриет сказалась больной, так что пришла одна только Пен. Угадайте-ка тогда, что мы сделали? Мы нарядили Чемберлена в женское платье, чтобы он сошел за даму, — вот была умора! Об этом не знал никто, кроме полковника и миссис Форстер. Да еще меня с Китти и тетки Филипс — надо же было нам взять у нее какие-то тряпки. Вы и представить себе не можете, до чего он здорово выглядел! Когда пришли Денни, и Уикхем, и Пратт, и еще двое или трое мужчин, они его совсем не узнали. Боже, как я хохотала! И миссис Форстер тоже. Мне казалось, что я помру со смеху. Оттого-то мужчины и заподозрили что-то неладное, — и, конечно, разгадали, в чем дело.</p>
<p>Такого рода описаниями вечеринок и проделок Лидия, при поддержке вставлявшей изредка свои замечания Китти, пыталась развлекать своих спутниц на протяжении всего пути до Лонгборна. Элизабет старалась ее не слушать, но не могла в этой болтовне не отметить частых упоминаний об Уикхеме.</p>
<p>Дома их встретили необыкновенно радушно. Миссис Беннет была счастлива убедиться, что Джейн по-прежнему хороша собой. А в течение обеда мистер Беннет не раз многозначительно обращался к Элизабет со словами:</p>
<p>— Я рад, что ты наконец вернулась, Лиззи.</p>
<p>Компания за обеденным столом была очень обширной, так как почти все Лукасы прибыли встретить Марию и разузнать обо всех новостях. О чем только здесь не говорилось! Леди Лукас через весь стол расспрашивала Марию о доме и птичнике своей старшей дочери. Миссис Беннет сразу участвовала в двух разговорах, справляясь у Джейн о новинках моды и пересказывая ответы Джейн младшим мисс Лукас. А тараторившая громче всех Лидия перечисляла радости первой половины этого дня, обращаясь ко всем, кто был готов ее слушать.</p>
<p>— Ой, Мэри, — кричала она, — как жаль, что ты с нами не поехала! Нам было безумно весело! Сперва мы катили с закрытыми шторками, — можно было подумать, что в карете никого нет. Я была готова проехать так весь путь, если бы только Китти не почувствовала дурноты. Зато у Джорджа, я надеюсь, мы вели себя превосходно. Мы накормили приезжих самым роскошным холодным завтраком в мире. Если бы ты выбралась с нами, мы бы и тебя угостили, честное слово! Ну, а когда мы вышли из гостиницы, вот была потеха! Я думала, мы так и не сможем забраться в карету, — прямо чуть не умерла со смеху. А как мы веселились на обратном пути! Мы разговаривали и хохотали так громко, что нас, наверно, слышали миль за десять!</p>
<p>Мэри ответила очень серьезно:</p>
<p>— Мне не к чему, дорогая сестрица, умалять значимость подобных развлечений. Они, правда, кажутся интересными большинству женщин. Но для меня, признаюсь, они лишены привлекательности. Чтение доставляет мне гораздо большее удовольствие.</p>
<p>Ее ответ едва ли дошел до ушей Лидии, которая редко слушала кого-нибудь дольше, чем полминуты, и никогда не обращала внимания на слова Мэри.</p>
<p>После обеда Лидия всячески уговаривала остальных барышень отправиться в Меритон и разузнать, как поживают их знакомые. Но против этого решительно возразила Элизабет, по мнению которой нельзя было позволить говорить про дочерей мистера Беннета, будто бы они и полдня не могут провести дома, не гоняясь за офицерами. У нее была и другая причина для возражений: ей не хотелось снова увидеть Уикхема, и она решила избегать встречи с ним как можно дольше. Поэтому ее особенно радовало предстоящее отбытие полка из Меритона. Через две недели офицеры уедут, а раз их не станет — ей больше ничто не напомнит об этом человеке.</p>
<p>Прошло немного времени после их приезда, когда Элизабет заметила, что план поездки в Брайтон, о котором Лидия болтала в гостинице, весьма часто обсуждается ее родителями. Ей было ясно, что отец вовсе не намерен потакать матери в этом деле. Но его ответы в то же время были настолько уклончивыми и замысловатыми, что у миссис Беннет, несмотря на все неудачи, сохранялась надежда в конце концов настоять на своем.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА XVII</p>
</div>
<p>Элизабет больше не могла противостоять желанию поделиться новостями со старшей сестрой. И на следующее утро, подготовив ее к необычайному сообщению, она наконец рассказала о сцене, происшедшей между нею и мистером Дарси. Подробности, которые касались самой Джейн, она, разумеется, опустила.</p>
<p>Удивление Джейн, однако, продолжалось недолго. Она ценила Элизабет так высоко, что всякая склонность к ней кого бы то ни было представлялась ей вполне естественной. А некоторое время спустя она и вовсе перестала удивляться услышанному, будучи поглощена уже совсем иными мыслями. Ее искренне огорчало, что мистер Дарси выразил свое чувство столь неподобающим образом. Однако еще сильнее ее тревожила мысль о том, как тяжело он должен был переживать отказ Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Его излишняя самоуверенность была, разумеется, неуместна, — сказала она. — И ему, конечно, не следовало ее обнаруживать. Но только подумай, насколько острее было при этом его разочарование.</p>
<p>— Что ж, я и в самом деле сочувствую ему всей душой, — ответила Элизабет. — Но надеюсь, что другие свойства его характера помогут ему избавиться от привязанности ко мне достаточно быстро. Ты ведь не осуждаешь меня за то, что я ему отказала?</p>
<p>— Осуждать тебя?! Разумеется, нет!</p>
<p>— А за то, что я так защищала Уикхема?</p>
<p>— Я не понимаю, почему бы тебе за него не вступиться.</p>
<p>— Ну так ты это поймешь, узнав, что случилось на другой день.</p>
<p>И она рассказала сестре про письмо, передав ей содержание той его части, которая касалась Джорджа Уикхема. Легко представить, как это разоблачение расстроило бедную Джейн, которая была готова пройти свой земной путь, убежденная, что всему человечеству свойственно меньше пороков, чем оказалось заключено в одном его представителе. Даже столь приятная ее сердцу возможность оправдать Дарси была не в силах ее утешить. И она со всей горячностью постаралась убедить сестру в существовании какого-то неизвестного обстоятельства, которое оправдывало бы одного человека и не бросало тень на другого.</p>
<p>— Ну уж это у тебя не получится! — возразила Элизабет. — Того и другого ты никак не сможешь представить одинаково добродетельными. Выбирай любого, но тебе придется ограничиться только одним. В них двоих заключена как раз та доза порядочности, которой хватает лишь на одну персону. И за последнее время стало неясно, кому эта доза на самом деле принадлежит. Мне, по крайней мере, начало казаться, что вся она перешла к мистеру Дарси. А ты, конечно, решай как тебе заблагорассудится.</p>
<p>Прошло, однако, известное время, прежде чем Джейн смогла хоть чуть-чуть улыбнуться.</p>
<p>— Едва ли когда-нибудь я была настолько потрясена, — сказала она. — Неужели Уикхем такой негодяй? Это кажется просто невероятным. Бедный мистер Дарси! Лиззи, миленькая, ты только подумай, что он должен был вынести! Так обмануться в своих надеждах. И тут же узнать, какого ты о нем ужасного мнения! И решиться рассказать тебе такие вещи про родную сестру! Как это все тяжело! Ты сама, я уверена, это чувствуешь.</p>
<p>— О нет, мои жалость и сочувствие улетучились, как только я увидела, насколько они переполняют тебя. С каждой минутой переживания мистера Дарси тревожат меня все меньше — настолько я убеждена, что ты должным образом войдешь в его положение. Твоя щедрость позволяет мне быть бережливой, и, если ты погорюешь о нем еще немного, сердце в моей груди станет легким, как перышко.</p>
<p>— Бедный Уикхем! А ведь он выглядит таким милым человеком, — с его открытым взглядом, очаровательными манерами!</p>
<p>— При создании этих двух молодых людей была в самом деле допущена великая несправедливость: первого наделили всеми достоинствами, а второго — одними их внешними проявлениями.</p>
<p>— Я с тобой никогда не соглашусь, что у мистера Дарси нет этих внешних проявлений.</p>
<p>— И все же, необоснованно относясь к нему с такой неприязнью, я гордилась своей проницательностью. Подобная неприязнь подстегивает ум и является самой плодотворной почвой для острословия! Можно беспрерывно болтать и так и не сказать ничего заслуживающего внимания. Но нельзя постоянно подшучивать над человеком без того, чтобы время от времени у тебя не вырвалось нечто действительно остроумное.</p>
<p>— Когда ты впервые прочла это письмо, Лиззи, ты, вероятно, не могла смотреть на вещи так, как сейчас.</p>
<p>— О да. Мне тогда было как-то не по себе. Очень не по себе, — я чувствовала себя просто несчастной. Мне не перед кем было излить свою душу. Со мной не было моей Джейн, которая, утешая меня, сказала бы, что я вовсе не та пустая, тщеславная и вздорная девчонка, какой я себя сознавала. Как мне хотелось, чтобы ты была рядом!</p>
<p>— Жалко, что, говоря с мистером Дарси об Уикхеме, ты употребила такие сильные выражения. Ведь на самом деле они оказались совсем незаслуженными.</p>
<p>— Еще бы. Впрочем, излишне резкий тон часто является следствием предубеждения. Мне, кстати, хотелось бы получить у тебя совет. Как ты думаешь, должна я открыть глаза на Уикхема нашим знакомым?</p>
<p>Мисс Беннет немного задумалась и затем ответила:</p>
<p>— По-моему, у нас нет повода для такого жестокого разоблачения. Как тебе кажется?</p>
<p>— Пожалуй, от него лучше воздержаться. Мистер Дарси не поручал мне распространять эти сведения. Напротив, все подробности, касавшиеся его сестры, предназначались лишь для меня. А если я расскажу о других провинностях Уикхема, разве кто-нибудь мне поверит? Предубеждение против Дарси настолько сильно, что половина жителей Меритона скорее в гроб ляжет, нежели посмотрит на Дарси сколько-нибудь доброжелательно. С этим ничего не поделаешь. К тому же Уикхем вот-вот уедет. А потому здесь едва ли кому-нибудь важно знать, что он собой представляет. Рано или поздно все станет известно. И тогда мы сможем вдоволь посмеяться над простотой тех, кто не догадывался об этом раньше. Пока что я собираюсь молчать.</p>
<p>— Ты безусловно права! Публичное разоблачение могло бы погубить его навсегда. Быть может, он уже жалеет о совершенных ошибках и хочет исправиться. Мы не должны сталкивать его в пропасть.</p>
<p>Разговор этот успокоил Элизабет. Она избавилась от двух давно тяготивших ее секретов, а в лице Джейн обрела собеседницу, всегда готовую ее выслушать, если ей захотелось бы вновь вернуться к их обсуждению. Осторожность, однако, заставила ее все же кое-что от сестры утаить. Она не осмеливалась пересказать Джейн другую часть письма мистера Дарси и открыть ей, насколько глубокой была на самом деле привязанность мистера Бингли. Этого Элизабет не могла поведать никому. И ей было достаточно ясно, что лишь возникновение полного доверия между Джейн и Бингли позволило бы ей ничего не утаивать. «А тогда, — говорила она себе самой, — если бы в самом деле случилось невероятное, я могла бы сказать только то, что гораздо более приятным образом высказал бы сам Бингли. И потому я обречена хранить эту тайну до той поры, пока она не утратит всякую цену».</p>
<p>Живя в семье, Элизабет теперь получила наконец возможность разобраться в истинном душевном состоянии сестры. Джейн не была счастлива. Она все еще хранила в душе нежную привязанность к Бингли. Не пережив прежде даже воображаемой влюбленности, она соединила в этом чувстве весь пыл первой любви со свойственным ее нраву и возрасту постоянством, которым столь редко отличаются первые увлечения. И она так дорожила воспоминаниями и так явно предпочитала Бингли всем другим молодым людям, что ей потребовалось призвать весь свой здравый смысл и проявить все возможное внимание к чувствам близких, чтобы не высказывать сожалений, вредных для ее здоровья и их спокойствия.</p>
<p>— Что ты теперь скажешь, Лиззи, об этой грустной истории с Джейн? — спросила как-то миссис Беннет. — Что касается меня, я твердо решила никогда больше об этом не заговаривать. Я так на днях и сказала сестрице Филипс. До сих пор не могу понять, виделась ли с ним Джейн в Лондоне? Что за никчемный человек! По-моему, ей больше нечего на него рассчитывать. О его возвращении этим летом в Незерфилд даже не поговаривают. Я спрашивала решительно всех, кто мог бы хоть что-нибудь об этом знать.</p>
<p>— Не думаю, что он вообще появится в Незерфилде.</p>
<p>— Тем лучше! Как ему будет угодно. Едва ли он кому-нибудь здесь понадобится. Хоть я всегда буду говорить, что он низко обошелся с моей дочерью. На месте Джейн я бы не пережила такого разочарования. И я утешаю себя мыслью, что, когда Джейн умрет от тоски, мистеру Бингли придется-таки пожалеть о том, что он натворил.</p>
<p>Элизабет промолчала, чувствуя себя не способной утешиться подобным предположением.</p>
<p>— Что ж, Лиззи, — продолжала миссис Беннет после короткой паузы, — по-твоему, Коллинзы в самом деле живут хорошо? Ну-ну, хотелось бы, чтобы это было надолго! А каков у них стол? Думаю, что из Шарлотты получилась неплохая хозяйка. Если она наполовину столь же изворотлива, как ее мамаша, они даже смогут кое-что откладывать. Они ведь не тратят на хозяйство слишком много?</p>
<p>— О да, конечно.</p>
<p>— Это очень важно для хорошего ведения дома. Да, да. Уж она-то постарается жить по средствам. Хотя нужда им и не грозит, да поможет им Бог. Представляю, как часто они вспоминают, что после смерти мистера Беннета Лонгборн станет их собственностью. Небось смотрят на него так, как будто он им уже принадлежит.</p>
<p>— При мне они не могли касаться подобной темы.</p>
<p>— Еще бы! Было бы странно, если бы они себе это позволили. Но я не сомневаюсь, что они без конца обсуждают это между собой. Ну что ж, если им ничего не стоит захватить чужое поместье, тем хуже для них. Я бы постыдилась принять что-нибудь в наследство по мужской линии!</p>

<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XVIII</p>
</div>
<p>Первая неделя после возвращения Джейн и Элизабет пролетела быстро. Началась вторая. Это была последняя неделя пребывания полка в Меритоне, и барышни всей округи находились в самом удрученном настроении. Уныние было почти всеобщим. Только две старшие мисс Беннет были способны еще есть, пить, спать и вести обычный образ жизни. Такая бесчувственность вызывала частые упреки со стороны безмерно несчастных Китти и Лидии, которые никак не могли допустить ее в ком-нибудь из членов своей семьи.</p>
<p>— Боже, что с нами станется! Что же мы будем делать? — восклицали они на каждом шагу в порыве отчаяния. — И ты, Лиззи, можешь еще улыбаться?</p>
<p>Преданная мамаша разделяла отчаяние дочек, припоминая собственные переживания при подобных обстоятельствах двадцать пять лет тому назад.</p>
<p>— Могу поклясться, что я проплакала два дня напролет, когда нас покинул полк полковника Миллера. Я тогда была уверена, что сердце мое разбито навеки.</p>
<p>— А я так ручаюсь, что мое сердце и в самом деле будет разбито! — сказала Лидия.</p>
<p>— Если бы только можно было съездить в Брайтон! — заметила миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>— О да, если бы только попасть в Брайтон! Но разве с папой договоришься!</p>
<p>— Купания в море поставили бы меня на ноги.</p>
<p>— Тетушка Филипс уверяет, что мне они просто необходимы, — вставила Китти.</p>
<p>Подобные причитания то и дело повторялись в доме Беннетов. Элизабет хотелось относиться к ним с юмором. Однако все смешное было для нее отравлено чувством стыда за близких. Снова и снова убеждалась она в справедливости упреков мистера Дарси. И никогда еще его вмешательство в дела друга не казалось ей столь оправданным.</p>
<p>Мрачное настроение Лидии, однако, внезапно рассеялось, когда она получила приглашение жены полковника Форстера сопровождать ее в Брайтон. Ее бесценная подруга была еще совсем молоденькой женщиной, лишь недавно вышедшей замуж. Беспечность и легкость нрава обеих сразу расположили их друг к другу, и после трехмесячного знакомства они сделались неразлучны.</p>
<p>Ликование Лидии по этому поводу, обожание, с которым она стала относиться к миссис Форстер, восторг миссис Беннет и отчаяние Китти едва ли могут быть описаны. Не обращая никакого внимания на чувства сестры, Лидия носилась по дому в непрерывном экстазе, добиваясь всеобщих поздравлений, хохоча и болтая больше, чем когда-либо прежде. В то же время в гостиной неудачливая Китти невразумительно и нудно роптала на свою судьбу.</p>
<p>— Никак не пойму, почему миссис Форстер не могла с таким же успехом пригласить и меня? — брюзжала Китти. — Мы с ней, правда, не очень близки. Но у меня не меньше прав получить приглашение, чем у Лидии. Даже больше! Я старше ее на два года!</p>
<p>Напрасно Элизабет пыталась ее урезонить, а Джейн — успокоить. Сама Элизабет отнеслась к этому приглашению совсем не так, как миссис Беннет и Лидия. Она боялась, что в результате поездки Лидия может лишиться последних крупиц здравого смысла. И как бы дорого ни обошелся ей такой шаг, узнай о нем ее домашние, она все же тайком посоветовала мистеру Беннету не отпускать Лидию в Брайтон. Она напомнила ему все случаи ее неразумного поведения, обратив внимание отца на сомнительную пользу, которую Лидия извлечет из дружбы с такой особой, как миссис Форстер. Ей казалось, что в Брайтоне, где соблазнов гораздо больше, чем дома, Лидия, находясь в подобной компании, может совершить еще более легкомысленные поступки. Внимательно ее выслушав, мистер Беннет ответил:</p>
<p>— Лидия ни за что не угомонится, пока где-нибудь не покажет себя на людях. И едва ли ей представится другой случай осуществить это с меньшими неудобствами для нашей семьи.</p>
<p>— Если бы вы знали, — сказала Элизабет, — какой ущерб может нам причинить бросающееся всем в глаза неосмотрительное и бестактное поведение Лидии! Больше того, какой ущерб им уже причинен! Тогда бы вы, я уверена, судили по-другому.</p>
<p>— Уже причинен? — переспросил мистер Беннет. — Что же, оно отпугнуло от тебя кого-нибудь из твоих поклонников? Бедная Лиззи! Но ты не должна падать духом. О таких привередливых юнцах, которые не переносят малейшего признака глупости своих ближних, не стоит жалеть. Ну-ка, назови мне тех жалких людишек, которых оттолкнуло легкомыслие Лидии.</p>
<p>— Вы ошибаетесь. Мне не приходится жаловаться на подобные разочарования. Я имела в виду не какие-либо отдельные случаи, а общий вред, который нам причиняют ее манеры. Наша репутация в обществе, уважение к нам знакомых подрываются взбалмошностью, самоуверенностью и крайней несдержанностью, свойственными ее характеру. Простите, я должна высказать свою мысль до конца. Если вы, дорогой отец, не возьмете на себя труд обуздать ее неудержимую натуру и разъяснить Лидии, что сегодняшние устремления не могут стать делом ее жизни, то скоро заниматься ее воспитанием будет уже поздно. Ее характер окончательно сформируется, и, к нашему общему позору, она к шестнадцати годам превратится в пустую кокетку. Кокетку худшего, самого низкого пошиба, не располагающую никакими достоинствами, кроме молодости и некоторой внешней привлекательности. Невежество и пустота сделают ее совершенно беззащитной перед всеобщим презрением, вызванным ее погоней за успехом. Той же опасности подвергается и Китти, которая во всем следует за Лидией — глупой, тщеславной, праздной и совершенно разнузданной девчонкой. Папа, дорогой, неужели вы полагаете, что, вызывая осуждение и презрение всех наших знакомых, они не бросают тень на репутацию своих сестер?</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет почувствовал, что Элизабет вложила в эти слова всю душу. Ласково взяв ее за руку, он сказал:</p>
<p>— Ты напрасно волнуешься, моя девочка. Все, кто знает тебя или Джейн, достаточно уважают и ценят вас обеих. И это мнение не может пострадать оттого, что у вас имеются две или, я даже мог бы сказать, три на редкость глупые сестры. В Лонгборне не будет покоя, если Лидия не попадет в Брайтон. Пусть же она туда поедет. Полковник Форстер — человек разумный. Он не допустит, чтобы она попала в настоящую неприятность. И, к счастью, она достаточно бедна, чтобы не привлекать к себе охотников за приданым. Ей даже флиртовать там станет труднее, чем здесь, — офицеры найдут в Брайтоне девиц, заслуживающих большего внимания. Будем надеяться, что эта поездка заставит ее почувствовать свою незначительность. Во всяком случае, ее поведение не может заметно испортиться без того, чтобы мы были вправе посадить ее до конца дней под замок.</p>
<p>Элизабет пришлось удовлетвориться этим ответом. Так как собственное ее мнение не изменилось, она ушла от отца разочарованная и огорченная. Не в ее характере, однако, было таить досаду, углубляясь в собственные переживания. Она сознавала, что выполнила свой долг, а печалиться заранее по поводу ожидаемых бед, усиливая их вдобавок своим беспокойством, ей было несвойственно.</p>
<p>Если бы Лидия и ее мать узнали, о чем она говорила с отцом, они едва ли смогли бы найти выход своему негодованию. Брайтонская поездка казалась Лидии вершиной земного счастья. Ее пылкое воображение рисовало улицы курортного городка, заполненные пока еще незнакомыми ей офицерами. Она видела себя предметом поклонения многих десятков молодых людей. Перед ее мысленным взором вставал во всем блеске военный лагерь — стройные ряды однообразных палаток и между ними веселые группы красавцев, щеголяющих в красных мундирах. И в довершение всего Лидия представляла себе, как она будет сидеть в одной из этих палаток и напропалую флиртовать по меньшей мере с шестью офицерами сразу.</p>
<p>Что бы она почувствовала, если бы узнала, что ее сестра пытается вырвать ее из этого уже такого близкого и такого заманчивого мира. Чувства эти способна была бы понять одна миссис Беннет, которая переживала почти то же самое. Только благодаря поездке Лидии она смогла примириться с мрачной решимостью мужа не пускать в Брайтон всю семью. Но, оставаясь в полном неведении о состоявшемся разговоре, обе они почти беспрерывно предавались восторгам до самого того дня, когда Лидия должна была покинуть Лонгборн.</p>
<p>Элизабет предстояло встретиться с Уикхемом в последний раз. Встреча эта уже не могла сколько-нибудь серьезно ее тревожить, так как она не раз виделась с ним после своего возвращения. Их прежняя близость исчезла. Она даже научилась замечать в самой пленявшей ее прежде мягкости Уикхема однообразную нарочитость, надоедающую и вызывающую досаду. Более того, она находила новые поводы для неудовольствия в том, как он стал к ней теперь относиться. В самом деле, напоследок он снова начал оказывать ей такое же внимание, каким было отмечено начало их знакомства и которое после всего происшедшего могло ее только оскорбить. И она потеряла к нему последнее уважение, как только заметила признаки этого праздного волокитства. Решительно отвергая его любезности, она видела в них упрек своему прежнему поведению. Только помня о нем, Уикхем мог считать, что при первом новом знаке внимания с его стороны она будет польщена и пойдет ему навстречу, независимо от того, по какой причине и на какой срок он от своего ухаживания воздерживался.</p>
<p>В самый последний день пребывания полка в Меритоне Уикхем вместе с другими офицерами обедал в Лонгборне. И, не стремясь расстаться с ним в дружеских отношениях, Элизабет в ответ на расспросы о ее жизни в Хансфорде рассказала ему о трехнедельном визите в Розингс полковника Фицуильяма и мистера Дарси, спросив при этом, знает ли он полковника.</p>
<p>Уикхем показался ей озадаченным, смущенным, настороженным. Однако после недолгого замешательства он, улыбаясь, ответил, что когда-то ему приходилось частенько встречаться с этим человеком. Охарактеризовав его как настоящего джентльмена, он спросил, какое впечатление полковник произвел на Элизабет. Она отозвалась о нем очень тепло. Как бы между прочим Уикхем вскоре осведомился:</p>
<p>— Сколько времени, вы сказали, он провел в Розингсе?</p>
<p>— Около трех недель.</p>
<p>— Вы часто с ним виделись?</p>
<p>— Да, почти ежедневно.</p>
<p>— Его манеры сильно отличаются от манер его кузена.</p>
<p>— Да, весьма сильно.</p>
<p>Но, узнав мистера Дарси ближе, я стала о нем думать гораздо лучше.</p>
<p>— Вот как? — сказал Уикхем, бросив на нее взгляд, не ускользнувший от ее внимания. — А могу ли я спросить… — Но, спохватившись, он продолжал небрежным тоном: — Стал ли он любезнее разговаривать с людьми? Или он снизошел до того, что придал некоторую обходительность своим манерам? Ибо я мало надеюсь, — проговорил он более низким и уже более серьезным голосом, — что он изменился к лучшему по существу.</p>
<p>— О нет, — сказала Элизабет, — по существу он остался таким, как был.</p>
<p>Уикхем явно не знал, как ему отнестись к этим словам — обрадоваться ли им или не доверять их смыслу. Что-то в ее лице заставило его насторожиться, когда она добавила:</p>
<p>— Признаваясь, что за время нашего знакомства он вырос в моем мнении, я не имела в виду перемены в его манерах или взглядах. Мне просто хотелось сказать, что, узнав его ближе, я стала лучше разбираться в его натуре.</p>
<p>Выступившие на лице Уикхема красные пятна и его беспокойный взгляд явно выдавали тревогу. Несколько минут он молчал. Наконец, преодолев смущение, он снова обернулся к ней и произнес особенно вкрадчивым тоном:</p>
<p>— Именно вам, хорошо знакомой с моими чувствами к мистеру Дарси, должно быть понятно, как рад я услышать, что у него хватило здравого смысла вести себя хотя бы внешне порядочно. Во многом это объясняется его гордостью. Она приносит немалую пользу если не ему самому, то хотя бы тем людям, которым приходится иметь с ним дело. Благодаря ей он не поступает с ними так дурно, как когда-то обошелся со мной. Боюсь только, что подмеченная вами, как я понял, большая его осмотрительность объясняется тем, что вы встретились с ним у его тетки, мнением которой он весьма дорожит. Насколько я знаю, он всегда робел в ее присутствии. А теперь еще немалую роль должно сыграть его намерение жениться на мисс де Бёр, которое, я уверен, он твердо решил осуществить.</p>
<p>При этих словах Элизабет не могла удержаться от улыбки, ответив ему только легким кивком. Было ясно, что он хочет навести разговор на тему о причиненном ему ущербе, но она не собиралась ему в этом потворствовать. До конца вечера он сохранял обычную напускную веселость, уже не стремясь оказывать ей предпочтение. И они наконец вежливо распрощались со взаимным желанием никогда больше не встречаться.</p>
<p>После того как гости разъехались, Лидия вместе с миссис Форстер отправилась в Меритон, который они должны были покинуть на следующее утро. Прощание с родными было скорее шумным, нежели трогательным. Одна только Китти проливала при этом слезы, да и то вызванные завистью и обидой. Миссис Беннет поминутно желала дочери всяческих удовольствий, требуя, чтобы она не пропустила ни одной возможности повеселиться — совет, которому та, несомненно, собиралась последовать. И ликующие прощальные возгласы Лидии так и не позволили ей расслышать менее громкие напутственные пожелания ее сестер.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id44"></span></span></p>
<div class="title3">
<p>ГЛАВА XIX</p>
</div>
<p>Если бы мнение Элизабет о супружеском счастье и домашнем уюте основывалось только на опыте, который она могла почерпнуть в своей семье, ей не удалось бы составить об этих понятиях благоприятного представления. Мистер Беннет связал свою судьбу с женщиной, привлекшей его молодостью и красотой, а также мнимым добродушием, впечатление о котором нередко бывает создано только названными выше внешними качествами. Еще в самом начале их брака эта женщина узостью взглядов и ограниченным развитием уничтожила в нем всякое чувство истинной супружеской привязанности. Уважение, доверие, духовная близость исчезли навсегда, а вместе с ними рассеялись все надежды на семейное счастье. Однако мистер Беннет по своему складу не относился к людям, которые, разочаровавшись в жизни вследствие собственной неосмотрительности, ищут утешения в сомнительных удовольствиях, слишком часто скрашивающих участь жертв порока и легкомыслия. Он любил природу и книги, и этими склонностями определялись его главные радости жизни. Своей жене он не был обязан ничем, если не считать развлечения, которое он получал, посмеиваясь над ее глупостью и невежеством. Это было совсем не то счастье, которым мужу обычно хотелось бы считать себя обязанным спутнице жизни. Но там, где нельзя радоваться иному, истинный философ умеет извлечь пользу из того, чем может располагать.</p>
<p>Элизабет никогда не закрывала глаза на то, что ее отец ведет себя не так, как должен был бы себя вести примерный супруг. Это причиняло ей постоянную боль. Но, уважая его ум и испытывая к нему благодарность за отцовскую нежность, она всегда старалась забыть то, что не могла не замечать, и не задумываться над тем, насколько он заслуживает порицания, постоянно нарушая долг уважения к жене и насмехаясь над ней в присутствии собственных детей. И теперь Элизабет впервые с полной отчетливостью осознала, сколько вреда этот неудачный брак должен был причинить выросшим в семье детям и к каким печальным последствиям приводило столь неразумное употребление способностей их отца. В самом деле, будучи верно направлены, эти способности по крайней мере помогли бы отцу воспитать достойных дочерей, если ему не под силу было расширить умственный кругозор своей жены.</p>
<p>Довольная отсутствием Уикхема, Элизабет, впрочем, находила мало других причин радоваться отбытию его полка. Встречи вне дома стали менее разнообразными. А непрерывные сетования миссис Беннет и Китти на скуку и впрямь делали семейную жизнь весьма унылой. И если Китти благодаря исчезновению источника беспокойства могла со временем снова обрести доступную ей меру здравого смысла, ее младшая сестра, характер которой таил в себе значительно больше опасностей, должна была под влиянием приморского городка и военного лагеря сделаться еще более ветреной и безрассудной. На этом примере Элизабет лишний раз убедилась, что долгожданное событие, осуществившись, вовсе не приносит ожидаемого удовлетворения. Приходится поэтому загадывать новый срок, по истечении которого должно будет наступить истинное блаженство, и намечать новую цель, на которой сосредоточились бы помыслы и желания, с тем чтобы, предвкушая ее осуществление, испытать радость, которая сгладила бы предшествовавшую неудачу и подготовила к новому разочарованию. В данное время ее помыслы сосредоточились на предстоящей поездке в Озерный край<a href="#ref16" class="a" onclick="save();">[24]</a>. Надеждами на эту поездку она утешала себя в самые безрадостные часы, омраченные дурным настроением матери и Китти. И если бы в путешествии могла принять участие Джейн, перспектива этой поездки была бы вполне совершенной.</p>
<p>— Впрочем, это даже хорошо, — рассуждала Элизабет, — если что-то произойдет не так, как мне бы хотелось. Если бы все было устроено по-моему, я непременно должна была бы со временем разочароваться. А теперь, постоянно грустя о предстоящей разлуке с Джейн, я могу в какой-то мере надеяться получить от поездки предвкушаемое удовольствие. Замысел, в котором все части складываются вполне удачно, никогда не бывает успешным. И только если какая-нибудь досадная мелочь нарушает гармонию, можно избежать полного разочарования.</p>
<p>Перед отъездом Лидия обещала матери и Китти присылать частые и подробные письма. Однако каждое письмо ожидалось подолгу и оказывалось весьма кратким. В письмах к матери Лидия сообщала только, что она и ее подруга сию минуту вернулись из библиотеки, куда их сопровождали такие-то и такие-то офицеры и где ее привели в неописуемый восторг необыкновенные орнаменты, или что у нее появилось новое платье или зонтик, который она описала бы подробнее, если бы ей не приходилось ужасно спешить, так как миссис Форстер торопит ее ехать в лагерь. А из писем к Китти сведений можно было почерпнуть и того меньше, ибо, хотя они были несколько пространнее, в них содержалось столько разных намеков, что их публичное чтение было совершенно невозможно.</p>
<p>Через две-три недели после ее отъезда в Лонгборне вновь начал пробуждаться дух здоровья, доброжелательства и хорошего настроения. Все приобрело теперь более радостную окраску. После проведенной в городе зимы возвращались знакомые семьи, замелькали летние наряды, и начались летние развлечения. Миссис Беннет вернулась в свое обычное состояние уравновешенной сварливости. А к середине июня Китти уже в такой мере пришла в себя, что могла появляться в Меритоне без слез — благоприятный симптом, позволявший Элизабет надеяться, что к Рождеству ее сестра наберется достаточно ума и сможет заговаривать об офицерах не чаще одного раза в сутки, — разумеется, если только какой-нибудь злонамеренный и жестокий чиновник из военного министерства не водворит в Меритоне новую войсковую часть.</p>
<p>Назначенный день отъезда на север теперь быстро приближался. Когда до него оставалось лишь две недели, от миссис Гардинер пришло письмо, в котором сообщалось, что начало их путешествия откладывается и что оно будет не таким продолжительным, как они предполагали. Дела позволяли мистеру Гардинеру выехать только в июле, спустя две недели после намеченного срока, и требовали его возвращения в Лондон через месяц после отъезда. И, поскольку оставалось слишком мало времени, чтобы ехать так далеко, как им прежде хотелось, и осмотреть ранее намеченные места (они ведь собирались передвигаться не спеша, чтобы извлекать из поездки удовольствие), от Озерного края приходилось отказаться и вместо него выбрать более близкую цель путешествия. Согласно новому плану, они не должны были удаляться на север за пределы Дербишира. В этом графстве можно было повидать достаточно много, чтобы на это ушли почти целиком три недели, оставшиеся в их распоряжении. А кроме того, оно обладало особой привлекательностью для миссис Гардинер. Городок, в котором она когда-то прожила несколько лет и где теперь им предстояло провести три-четыре дня, имел для нее не меньший интерес, чем прославленные красотами Мэтлок<a href="#ref15" class="a" onclick="save();">[25]</a>, Четсуорт<a href="#ref14" class="a" onclick="save();">[26]</a>, Давдейл<a href="#ref13" class="a" onclick="save();">[27]</a> и Пик<a href="#ref12" class="a" onclick="save();">[28]</a>.</p>
<p>Элизабет была заметно разочарована. Она уже приготовилась к путешествию в Озерный край, и ей казалось, что им для него вполне хватило бы времени. Приходилось, однако, соглашаться, не теряя при этом хорошего расположения духа. И вскоре она снова почувствовала себя счастливой.</p>
<p>Упоминание Дербишира будило множество мыслей. Это название было неразрывно связано с поместьем Пемберли и его владельцем.</p>
<p>— Но неужели я не могу безнаказанно наведаться в его графство, — рассудила Элизабет, — и похитить оттуда на память несколько красивых камней, не попав ему на глаза?</p>
<p>Ждать предстояло вдвое дольше. До прибытия дяди и тетки должно было пройти четыре недели. Но наконец остались позади и они, и мистер и миссис Гардинер в сопровождении четырех детей прибыли в Лонгборн. Дети — девочки шести и восьми лет и два мальчика поменьше — должны были остаться на попечении всеобщей любимицы Джейн, чей здравый смысл и чудесный характер особенно располагали к тому, чтобы ей был поручен уход за ними: их обучение, игра с ними и, прежде всего, сердечное к ним внимание.</p>
<p>Гардинеры провели в Лонгборне всего одну ночь и уже на следующее утро вместе с Элизабет отправились на поиски новых впечатлений. Одно благоприятное обстоятельство было им обеспечено: спутники во всем прекрасно подходили друг к другу. Они обладали здоровьем и выдержкой, благодаря чему могли легко переносить дорожные неурядицы, жизнерадостностью, которая должна была усилить любое ожидавшее их удовольствие, а также добрым нравом и осведомленностью, которые помогли бы им приятно проводить время в отсутствие интересных впечатлений от путешествия.</p>
<p>Целью настоящего повествования не является описание всего Дербишира или каких-нибудь примечательных мест по пути к этому графству. Оксфорд, Бленхейм, Уорик<a href="#ref11" class="a" onclick="save();">[29]</a>, Кенилворт<a href="#ref10" class="a" onclick="save();">[30]</a>, Бирмингем и т.д. достаточно хорошо известны. Нас поэтому будет интересовать только небольшой уголок Дербишира. Осмотрев все расположенные на пути главные достопримечательности, они направились в маленький городок Лэмтон, где когда-то жила миссис Гардинер и где, по недавно полученным ею сведениям, еще оставались некоторые ее старые знакомые. Из ее рассказов Элизабет узнала, что Лэмтон находится лишь в пяти милях от Пемберли. Их путь в городок проходил совсем близко от имения Дарси, расположенного всего в одной или двух милях в сторону от дороги. И при обсуждении вечером планов на следующий день миссис Гардинер изъявила желание снова взглянуть на это поместье. Мистер Гардинер охотно с ней согласился. Требовалось только согласие Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Не правда ли, дорогая, тебе будет приятно осмотреть места, о которых ты столько слышала? — спросила тетушка. — Они напомнят тебе так много твоих знакомых! Здесь, как ты знаешь, провел свою юность Уикхем.</p>
<p>Элизабет чувствовала себя очень неловко. Она считала, что ей совершенно нечего делать в Пемберли. И, сказав, что ее утомили богатые дома и что после того, как они осмотрели их такое множество, ей перестало доставлять удовольствие созерцание роскошных ковров и атласных занавесок, она попыталась уклониться от этой поездки.</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер, однако, упрекнула ее за такую нелюбознательность.</p>
<p>— Если бы речь шла только о красивом, богато обставленном доме, — сказала она, — я бы и сама не стала об этом говорить. Но ведь Пемберли славится восхитительными видами. Это поместье гордится одним из лучших парков страны.</p>
<p>Элизабет ничего не ответила, но душа ее решительно протестовала. Ей представилось, что во время осмотра поместья она может встретить мистера Дарси. Это было бы ужасно! Кровь приливала к ее лицу при одной только мысли о такой встрече, и она предпочла бы рассказать обо всем тетушке, нежели подвергнуться подобному риску. Но и на это ей было трудно отважиться, и в конце концов она решила прибегнуть к объяснению лишь в крайнем случае, — если, осведомившись о местопребывании владельца Пемберли, она получит неблагоприятный ответ.</p>
<p>Поэтому, укладываясь спать, она расспросила горничную, действительно ли Пемберли является таким прекрасным поместьем, кому оно принадлежит и — не без серьезной тревоги — приехала ли уже туда на лето семья владельца. Услышав на последний вопрос столь желанный отрицательный ответ и успокоив свою тревогу, она стала с интересом ждать посещения этого места. Когда на следующее утро вопрос о поездке в Пемберли подвергся новому обсуждению и ей пришлось снова высказать мнение по этому поводу, она смогла без запинки и с вполне равнодушным видом сказать, что не имеет особых возражений против предложенного плана.</p>
<p>И они отправились в Пемберли.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА I</p>
</div>
<p>Ожидая появления Пемберлейского леса<a href="#ref9" class="a" onclick="save();">[31]</a>, Элизабет всматривалась в дорогу с большим волнением. И когда, миновав сторожку, они наконец свернули в усадьбу, возбуждение ее дошло до предела.</p>
<p>Отдельные части обширного парка составляли весьма разнообразную картину. Начав осмотр с одного из его самых низменных мест, они некоторое время ехали по красивой, широко раскинувшейся роще.</p>
<p>Хотя Элизабет была настолько взволнована, что ей трудно было участвовать в разговоре, она любовалась каждым приветливым уголком и каждым красивым видом. На протяжении полумили они медленно поднимались и в конце концов внезапно выехали на свободную от леса возвышенность, с которой широко открывался вид на долину с господским домом, стоявшим на ее противоположном краю. Это было величественное каменное здание, удачно расположенное на склоне гряды лесистых холмов. Протекавший в долине полноводный ручей без заметных искусственных сооружений превращался перед домом в более широкий поток, берега которого не казались излишне строгими или чрезмерно ухоженными. Элизабет была в восторге. Никогда еще она не видела места, которое было бы более щедро одарено природой и в котором естественная красота была так мало испорчена недостаточным человеческим вкусом. Все были единодушны в своем восхищении. В этот момент она вполне оценила, что значило бы стать владелицей Пемберли!</p>
<p>Они спустились в долину, проехали по мосту и приблизились к дому. И когда она стала его рассматривать, стоя под его стенами, в ней снова проснулся страх, как бы ей не пришлось встретиться с его владельцем. Ей не давала покоя мысль, что горничная в гостинице могла ошибиться. После того как они попросили разрешения осмотреть дом, их пригласили в вестибюль. И, пока они ожидали домоправительницу, Элизабет могла вполне надивиться тому, куда ее привела судьба.</p>
<p>Домоправительница появилась. Это была почтенная пожилая женщина, гораздо менее чинная и более приветливая, чем можно было судить по первому впечатлению. Гости последовали за ней в столовую — просторную комнату с удачными пропорциями и изящным убранством. Окинув ее взглядом, Элизабет подошла к окну, чтобы полюбоваться открывшимся из него видом. Увенчанный лесом холм, с которого они только что спустились, издали казавшийся более крутым, чем вблизи, представлял прекрасное зрелище. Все вокруг радовало глаз, и Элизабет с наслаждением рассматривала пейзаж: реку, разбросанные по берегам деревья и изгибы терявшейся у горизонта долины. Пока они проходили по другим комнатам, ландшафт менялся, но из каждого окна было чем полюбоваться. В комнатах были высокие потолки и богатая обстановка, достойная владельца такого поместья. И, восхищаясь его вкусом, Элизабет заметила, что эта обстановка не казалась излишне пышной и выглядела менее роскошной и в то же время более изящной, чем обстановка в Розингсе.</p>
<p>«И здесь-то я чуть было не стала хозяйкой! — размышляла Элизабет. — Я могла бы уже привыкнуть к этим комнатам! Вместо того чтобы осматривать их в качестве случайной посетительницы, я пользовалась бы ими как собственными, приветствуя тут в качестве своих гостей мистера и миссис Гардинер! Впрочем, нет, — спохватилась она, — это было бы невозможно. Дядя и тетя были бы для меня навсегда потеряны. Мне никогда не позволили бы их сюда пригласить».</p>
<p>Эта мысль пришла ей в голову как раз вовремя, избавив ее от чувства, чем-то похожего на сожаление.</p>
<p>Ей очень хотелось узнать у домоправительницы, в самом ли деле владелец поместья находится сейчас в отъезде, но у нее не хватало духу для прямого вопроса. Он был задан в конце концов мистером Гардинером. Отвернувшись, дабы скрыть беспокойство, Элизабет услышала, что миссис Рейнолдс ответила на него утвердительно, добавив при этом:</p>
<p>— Мы ждем его завтра. Он прибывает сюда вместе со своими друзьями.</p>
<p>Как обрадовалась Элизабет, что по какой-нибудь случайной причине они не отложили поездки!</p>
<p>В эту минуту миссис Гардинер позвала ее посмотреть на одну из картин. Элизабет приблизилась и среди прочих миниатюр над камином увидела портрет мистера Уикхема. Тетушка спросила ее с улыбкой, насколько он ей понравился. А подошедшая к ним домоправительница объяснила, что изображенный на портрете молодой человек — сын прежнего управляющего, воспитанный покойным мистером Дарси на свои средства.</p>
<p>— Сейчас он поступил в армию, — добавила она, — но боюсь, человек из него вышел совсем никудышный.</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер, улыбаясь, взглянула на племянницу, но Элизабет не смогла ответить ей тем же.</p>
<p>— А вот, — сказала миссис Рейнолдс, показывая на другую миниатюру, — портрет нашего хозяина, очень похожий. Оба портрета были написаны одновременно, около восьми лет тому назад.</p>
<p>— Мне много рассказывали о мистере Дарси, — заметила миссис Гардинер, разглядывая миниатюру. — Судя по портрету, у него очень приятное лицо. Но, Лиззи, ты ведь и сама можешь судить о сходстве?</p>
<p>Уважение миссис Рейнолдс к Элизабет явно возросло, когда она услышала о ее знакомстве с владельцем Пемберли.</p>
<p>— Эта юная леди знает мистера Дарси?</p>
<p>— Совсем немного, — сказала Элизабет, покраснев.</p>
<p>— А не кажется ли вам, сударыня, что он необыкновенно хорош собой?</p>
<p>— О да, вы совершенно правы.</p>
<p>— Я не встречала другого такого красивого человека. Наверху в галерее вы увидите его портрет больших размеров и еще более удачный. Но мой покойный хозяин всегда любил эту комнату, и миниатюры висят здесь точно так, как они висели при нем. Он ими очень дорожил.</p>
<p>Это объясняло присутствие здесь портрета мистера Уикхема. Миссис Рейнолдс обратила их внимание на портрет мисс Дарси, написанный, когда ей было лишь восемь лет.</p>
<p>— Ну, а мисс Дарси так же красива, как ее брат? — спросил мистер Гардинер.</p>
<p>— О несомненно, — воскликнула миссис Рейнолдс. — Она не уступит лучшим красавицам на свете. А как хорошо она воспитана! Она способна заниматься музыкой с утра до вечера. Рядом в комнате вы увидите только что привезенный для нее инструмент — подарок нашего хозяина. Завтра мы ее ждем вместе с мистером Дарси.</p>
<p>Любезные и непринужденные расспросы и замечания мистера Гардинера поощряли словоохотливость миссис Рейнолдс, которая то ли из тщеславия, то ли под влиянием искренней привязанности говорила о мистере Дарси и его сестре с видимым удовольствием.</p>
<p>— Ваш хозяин проводит в Пемберли много времени?</p>
<p>— Не так много, сэр, как мне бы хотелось. Но смею сказать, здесь протекает около половины его жизни. А мисс Дарси живет здесь каждое лето.</p>
<p>«Кроме того, — подумала Элизабет, — которое она провела в Рэмсгейте».</p>
<p>— Когда ваш хозяин женится, вы сможете видеть его гораздо больше.</p>
<p>— О да, сэр. Но мне неизвестно, когда это случится. Я не знаю никого, кто был бы хоть сколько-нибудь достоин стать его супругой.</p>
<p>Мистер и миссис Гардинер улыбнулись, а Элизабет, не удержавшись, заметила:</p>
<p>— Ваше мнение о нем, мне кажется, красноречиво говорит в его пользу.</p>
<p>— Я говорю одну только правду, — мои слова подтвердит всякий, кто знает мистера Дарси, — ответила миссис Рейнолдс.</p>
<p>Элизабет показалось, что это звучит довольно смело. С возрастающим изумлением она услышала, как миссис Рейнолдс добавила: — За всю жизнь он не сказал мне ни одного резкого слова. А ведь я знаю его с четырехлетнего возраста.</p>
<p>Эти слова особенно поразили Элизабет, настолько они шли вразрез с ее собственным представлением о Дарси. До сих пор она была уверена, что у него нелегкий характер. Ее внимание было обострено до предела. Ей не терпелось узнать еще что-нибудь, и она была от души благодарна мистеру Гардинеру, который сказал:</p>
<p>— Не многие люди заслуживают подобных похвал. Вы, должно быть, весьма счастливы, имея такого хозяина.</p>
<p>— О да, сэр, мне в самом деле очень повезло. Лучшего мне не сыскать в целом свете. Но я всегда замечала, что добрые дети вырастают хорошими людьми. А он был самым отзывчивым, самым благородным мальчиком, какого мне когда-либо приходилось встречать.</p>
<p>Элизабет не отрывала от нее глаз.</p>
<p>«Неужели речь идет о мистере Дарси?» — думала она.</p>
<p>— Его отец славился своей добротой, — заметила миссис Гардинер.</p>
<p>— О да, сударыня, вполне заслуженно. И сын его будет точь-в-точь такой же. Он так же добр к простым людям.</p>
<p>Элизабет слушала, удивлялась, сомневалась и горела желанием узнать больше. Миссис Рейнолдс не могла заинтересовать ее ничем другим. Все, что она рассказывала о сюжетах картин, размерах комнат и стоимости обстановки, Элизабет пропускала мимо ушей. Мистера Гардинера очень забавляло проявление фамильного тщеславия, объяснявшего, по его мнению, преувеличенные похвалы мистеру Дарси со стороны его домоправительницы. Поэтому он постарался снова вернуться к прежней теме. И пока они поднимались по длинной лестнице, миссис Рейнолдс с упоением продолжала описывать многочисленные достоинства своего патрона:</p>
<p>— Это лучший землевладелец и лучший хозяин из всех когда-либо существовавших на свете, — сказала она. — Не то что теперешние беспутные молодые люди, которые думают только о себе. Не найдется ни одного его арендатора или работника, который бы не сказал о нем доброго слова. Кое-кто находит его слишком гордым. Но я этого не замечала. Этот упрек, мне кажется, вызван тем, что, в отличие от современных молодых людей, он не интересуется пустяками.</p>
<p>«В каком выгодном свете рисуют мистера Дарси эти слова!» — думала Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Этот блестящий отзыв, — шепнула ей тетка, — не вполне сочетается с его отношением к нашему бедному другу.</p>
<p>— Быть может, нас по этому поводу ввели в заблуждение?</p>
<p>— Едва ли это могло случиться. Мы получили сведения из такого надежного источника.</p>
<p>Пройдя просторную переднюю во втором этаже, они заглянули в очаровательную гостиную с еще более легкой и изящной обстановкой, чем в нижних помещениях. Домоправительница объяснила, что эту комнату только на днях отделали, чтобы порадовать мисс Дарси, которой она прошлым летом особенно полюбилась.</p>
<p>— У нее и правда заботливый брат, — сказала Элизабет, подходя к одному из окон.</p>
<p>Миссис Рейнолдс заранее предвкушала восторг мисс Дарси при виде новой отделки.</p>
<p>— И это так на него похоже! — добавила она. — Все, что может доставить сестре хоть малейшее удовольствие, делается сейчас же. Он использует любую возможность.</p>
<p>Им оставалось осмотреть только картинную галерею и две или три большие спальни. В галерее оказалось немало прекрасных полотен, но Элизабет слабо разбиралась в живописи. И, устав от нее еще при осмотре первого этажа, она охотно принялась рассматривать более доступные и близкие ей карандашные наброски мисс Дарси.</p>
<p>Разглядывая множество семейных портретов, которые едва ли могли привлечь внимание постороннего, Элизабет искала среди них единственное лицо со знакомыми чертами. В конце концов оно бросилось ей в глаза, и она была поражена удивительным сходством портрета с мистером Дарси. На полотне была запечатлена та самая улыбка, которую она нередко видела на его лице, когда он смотрел на нее. Несколько минут Элизабет сосредоточенно в него вглядывалась. И, покидая галерею, она еще раз к нему подошла, услышав от миссис Рейнолдс, что портрет был написан еще при жизни прежнего хозяина.</p>
<p>В эту минуту Элизабет явно испытывала к оригиналу портрета более теплое чувство, чем когда-либо на протяжении их знакомства. Восторги миссис Рейнолдс не могли не произвести впечатления. Может ли что-нибудь звучать убедительнее, чем хвалебный отзыв разумной прислуги? Она размышляла над огромной ответственностью за человеческие судьбы, которая возлагалась на Дарси его положением старшего брата, землевладельца, хозяина дома. Сколько мог он принести людям добра и зла! Сколько радостей и горестей находилось в его власти! Каждая черточка его характера, упоминавшаяся домоправительницей, располагала в его пользу. И, стоя перед полотном, с которого на нее смотрели его глаза, Элизабет думала о его чувстве с гораздо более глубоким участием, чем когда-либо прежде: она вспоминала, как пламенно признался он ей в своей любви, и старалась загладить в памяти неподобающую форму этого признания.</p>
<p>Когда были осмотрены все открытые для обозрения уголки дома, они снова сошли вниз и, распрощавшись с домоправительницей, оказались на попечении встретившего их около дверей холла садовника.</p>
<p>Спускаясь по газонам к реке, Элизабет обернулась, чтобы еще раз оглядеть здание. Мистер и миссис Гардинер тоже остановились.</p>
<p>И пока первый высказывал предположение о времени постройки дома, из-за угла, по дорожке, которая вела к конюшне, вышел его владелец.</p>
<p>Между ними было всего двадцать ярдов, и он появился настолько внезапно, что избежать его взгляда было для Элизабет совершенно невозможно. Глаза их встретились, и лица обоих вспыхнули багровым румянцем. Мистер Дарси вздрогнул и сначала, казалось, оцепенел от изумления. Но, быстро придя в себя, он пошел к ним навстречу и заговорил с ней, хотя и не вполне владея собой, однако самым учтивым образом.</p>
<p>В первый момент Элизабет инстинктивно отвернулась и сделала несколько шагов в сторону. Но когда он с ней поравнялся, она растерянно остановилась и выслушала его приветствие. Если появление мистера Дарси и его сходство с только что виденным портретом недостаточно уверило ее спутников, что перед ними владелец поместья, то изумление, которое при виде хозяина изобразилось на лице садовника, подтвердило это с полной убедительностью. Пока Дарси беседовал с их племянницей, они стояли поодаль. Не смея поднять глаза, совершенно ошеломленная, Элизабет бессознательно отвечала на любезные расспросы о своей семье. Ее поразило, насколько переменились, по сравнению с их последней встречей, его манеры. С каждой новой фразой она испытывала все возраставшее смущение. И несколько минут этого разговора, в течение которых она сознавала только, до чего неприлично было ей оказаться застигнутой в этом месте, стали самыми неловкими в ее жизни. Мистер Дарси чувствовал себя не намного увереннее: в его словах не было обычной невозмутимости. Бессвязно повторяя вопросы о том, когда она покинула Лонгборн и сколько дней ей довелось провести в Дербишире, он явно обнаруживал свое смятение.</p>
<p>Под конец, не зная, что бы сказать еще, он замолк и, простояв с минуту в молчании, вдруг опомнился и пошел прочь.</p>
<p>Мистер и миссис Гардинер тотчас же подошли к Элизабет и выразили восхищение его внешностью. Однако, поглощенная своими мыслями, Элизабет едва ли расслышала их слова и шла за ними в полном молчании. От стыда и унижения она почувствовала себя совершенно подавленной. Визит в Пемберли казался ей самым злосчастным, самым ошибочным шагом в ее жизни. Каким странным должен был показаться он мистеру Дарси! Как опозорена была бы она даже и не перед столь тщеславным человеком! Можно было подумать, что она намеренно постаралась снова оказаться у него на пути! Зачем она сюда приехала? И надо же было ему явиться за день до назначенного срока! Достаточно им было выйти из замка всего на десять минут раньше, и он бы их не застал! Было ясно, что он прибыл сию минуту — только что соскочил с лошади или вышел из экипажа. И она снова и снова краснела, сознавая все неприличие ее появления в Пемберли. Но как изменилось поведение мистера Дарси! Чем это можно объяснить? Следовало удивляться, что он вообще стал с ней разговаривать. И разговаривать так учтиво, — осведомляться о ее близких! Никогда еще он не говорил с ней так сердечно, без малейшего высокомерия, как при этой нежданной встрече. Насколько это отличалось от его последнего обращения к ней в Розингсе, когда он передал ей свое письмо! Элизабет не знала, что ей об этом думать и как все объяснить.</p>
<p>Они теперь шли по восхитительной тропинке у самой воды. С каждым шагом перед ними открывались все более красивые склоны, все более живописный вид на приближавшуюся лесную чащу. Однако Элизабет смогла снова воспринимать окружающий мир далеко не сразу. Машинально отвечая на повторные обращения мистера и миссис Гардинер или рассматривая заинтересовавшие их виды, она думала совсем о другом. Ее мысленному взору представлялась та единственная, хоть и неизвестная комната дома, в которой должен был сейчас находиться мистер Дарси. Ей хотелось понять, какие мысли бродят у него сейчас в голове, что он о ней думает и сохранил ли к ней, вопреки всему, нежное чувство. Не был ли он так любезен только потому, что чувствовал себя здесь более свободно? Но в его голосе слышалось нечто такое, что нельзя было счесть за непринужденность. Было неясно — обрадовался ли он этой встрече или она его расстроила. Во всяком случае, он не отнесся к ней безразлично.</p>
<p>Замечания спутников по поводу ее рассеянного вида под конец вывели Элизабет из задумчивости и заставили ее взять себя в руки.</p>
<p>Они вошли в чащу и, на время расставшись с рекой, побрели вверх по склону холма. Там, где просветы между деревьями оставляли взору достаточный простор, открывался прекрасный вид на долину и противоположные покрытые лесом холмы, скрывавшие также некоторые излучины реки. Мистер Гардинер выразил желание обойти весь парк, но побоялся, что за одну прогулку это окажется им не под силу. В ответ на его слова садовник с довольной усмешкой сказал, что им потребовалось бы пройти не меньше десяти миль. Это решило вопрос, и они двинулись дальше по избранному пути. Дорога снова пошла под гору. Пробравшись под низко склоненными деревьями, они опять спустились к сильно сузившейся в этом месте реке и пересекли ее по незамысловатому мостику, вполне гармонировавшему с окружающей природой. Рука человека чувствовалась здесь еще меньше, чем во всех виденных ими до сих пор уголках парка. И сжатая ущельем долина оставляла пространство только для потока и узкой, окаймленной кустарником дорожки. Элизабет очень хотелось обследовать течение реки. Но, внезапно сообразив, как далеко они отошли от дома, миссис Гардинер, которая не привыкла много ходить пешком, отказалась идти дальше и потребовала, чтобы они поскорее вернулись. Племяннице пришлось подчиниться, и они пошли кратчайшим путем к оставленному ими на другом берегу экипажу. Двигались они, однако, не слишком быстро. Пристрастие мистера Гардинера к рыбной ловле, которое ему случалось удовлетворять весьма редко, заставляло их то и дело останавливаться, пока он разглядывал плещущуюся в реке форель или толковал с садовником о повадках этой рыбы. Медленно бредя таким образом, они вдруг заметили направляющегося к ним мистера Дарси. Элизабет была изумлена почти так же, как тогда, когда он появился в первый раз перед домом. Благодаря тому что тропинка была не настолько скрыта деревьями, как на другом берегу, они увидели Дарси на таком расстоянии, чтобы успеть подготовиться к встрече. И, несмотря на свое удивление, Элизабет смогла собраться с мыслями, чтобы говорить с ним, если он в самом деле к ним подойдет, достаточно спокойно. На секунду ей почудилось, что он все же предпочел свернуть в боковую просеку. Но это предположение просуществовало ровно столько времени, сколько потребовалось, чтобы он успел миновать скрывший его изгиб дороги. Тотчас после этого он предстал перед ними. С первого взгляда она заметила, что он держится так же учтиво, как во время их встречи около дома. Стараясь быть столь же любезной, Элизабет выразила свое восхищение красотой местности. Но, повторив раза два «очаровательно» и «прелестно», она спохватилась, что в ее устах восхваления Пемберли могут получить неправильное истолкование, и, покраснев, внезапно умолкла.</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер стояла поодаль, и мистер Дарси, воспользовавшись паузой, попросил Элизабет оказать ему честь и представить его своим друзьям. Такой учтивости она от него совершенно не ожидала. И, едва сдержав улыбку, она подумала, что Дарси ищет знакомства с людьми, против которых так восставала его гордость, когда он просил ее руки.</p>
<p>«Как должен будет он удивиться, — подумала она, — узнав, кто они такие! Он ведь предполагает, что они принадлежат к светскому обществу».</p>
<p>Тем не менее она сразу их познакомила. Сказав, что приходится Гардинерам племянницей, она искоса взглянула на Дарси, вполне допуская, что он постарается поскорее сбежать от столь неподходящей компании. Упоминание об их родственных связях, несомненно, застало его врасплох. Однако Дарси принял это сообщение достаточно мужественно и не только не сделал попытки удалиться, но даже пошел рядом, вступив с мистером Гардинером в оживленную беседу. Элизабет не могла не испытывать удовлетворения, не могла не торжествовать. Как утешительно было сознавать, что он познакомился наконец с теми из ее родственников, за которых ей наверняка не придется краснеть! Вслушиваясь в их разговор, она радовалась каждой фразе своего дяди, каждому выражению, свидетельствовавшему о его уме, вкусе и превосходных манерах.</p>
<p>Беседа вскоре коснулась рыболовства, и она услышала, как мистер Дарси весьма любезным образом пригласил ее дядю во время их пребывания в Дербишире ловить рыбу в его имении. Одновременно он предложил снабдить его необходимыми снастями и показал наиболее удобные для ловли места. Миссис Гардинер, которая шла бок о бок с племянницей, бросила на нее изумленный взгляд. Элизабет промолчала, но чувствовала себя необыкновенно довольной. Такое внимание, очевидно, проявлялось ради нее одной. Все это, однако, крайне ее удивляло, так что она не переставала себя спрашивать: «Почему он так изменился? Чем это объясняется? Не может быть, чтобы это случилось из-за меня. Не может быть, чтобы ради меня он стал вести себя так учтиво! То, что я высказала ему тогда в Хансфорде, не могло повлиять на него так сильно! Не любит же он меня до сих пор?!»</p>
<p>В течение какого-то времени все шли в том же порядке: дамы — впереди, мужчины — в нескольких шагах сзади. Но после того как им пришлось спуститься к воде, чтобы взглянуть на какое-то занятное водяное растение, произошла некоторая перестановка. Миссис Гардинер, утомленная долгой прогулкой, почувствовала, что рука племянницы служит ей недостаточной опорой, и предпочла опереться на руку мужа. Мистер Дарси занял ее место рядом с Элизабет, и они двинулись дальше. После некоторого молчания Элизабет заговорила первая. Ей хотелось объяснить, насколько она была уверена в его отсутствии, когда решилась посетить Пемберли. Поэтому она высказала свое удивление его неожиданным приездом.</p>
<p>— Ваша домоправительница, — прибавила она, — утверждала с уверенностью, что вы не приедете раньше завтрашнего утра, и то же самое нам сказали перед выездом из Бейкуэлла. Сегодня вас здесь не ждали.</p>
<p>Дарси подтвердил, что приехал в самом деле неожиданно, и объяснил это необходимостью встретиться с управляющим до прибытия своих друзей.</p>
<p>— Они приедут завтра утром, — продолжал он. — И вы найдете среди них старых знакомых — мистера Бингли и его сестер.</p>
<p>Элизабет ответила легким кивком. Мысли ее мгновенно перенеслись к тому времени, когда имя Бингли было произнесено между ними в последний раз. И, насколько она могла судить по выражению лица мистера Дарси, он думал о том же.</p>
<p>— Среди них будет еще одна особа, — продолжал он после некоторой паузы, — которая самым искренним образом хотела бы с вами познакомиться. Позволите ли вы мне, — или я прошу слишком многого, — представить вам, пользуясь вашим визитом в Лэмтон, мою сестру?</p>
<p>Такая просьба не могла не вызвать ее удивления. Было трудно понять, чем она ее заслужила. Однако было ясно, что мисс Дарси могла захотеть с ней познакомиться только под влиянием брата. Так или иначе Элизабет не видела в этом ничего дурного. И ей было радостно сознавать, что он не думает о ней плохо, несмотря на нанесенную ему обиду.</p>
<p>Теперь они шли молча, каждый глубоко погруженный в свои мысли. Состояние Элизабет нельзя было назвать приятным — об этом не могло быть и речи. Но она была польщена и тронута. Желание познакомить ее с мисс Дарси казалось особенно тонким комплиментом. Вскоре они намного опередили своих спутников. Когда они подошли к экипажу, мистер и миссис Гардинер отстали от них почти на четверть мили.</p>
<p>Дарси пригласил ее войти в дом, но она ответила, что не чувствует усталости, и оба остались стоять на лужайке. В подобных, располагающих к беседе обстоятельствах молчать было особенно неловко. Ей хотелось начать разговор, но любая возможная тема казалась запретной. Наконец, вспомнив, что в данный момент она является путешественницей, Элизабет упомянула о Мэтлоке и Давдейле, и они с большим увлечением начали обсуждать красоты Дербишира. Однако время и ее тетушка подвигались настолько медленно, что к концу этого tete-a-tete ей уже почти ничего не могло прийти в голову для поддержания разговора.</p>
<p>Когда Гардинеры наконец приблизились, он пригласил всех зайти в дом, чтобы немного закусить. Приглашение, однако, было отклонено, и они расстались самым любезным образом. Мистер Дарси помог обеим дамам сесть в экипаж, и, когда лошади тронулись, Элизабет увидела, как он медленно пошел по направлению к дому.</p>
<p>Мистер и миссис Гардинер не преминули высказать свои впечатления. Оба заявили, что мистер Дарси намного превзошел их ожидания.</p>
<p>— Он превосходно себя держит: по-настоящему учтиво и скромно, — сказал мистер Гардинер.</p>
<p>— Конечно, в нем есть некоторая величавость, но она скорее относится к его внешности и нисколько его не портит, — заметила миссис Гардинер. — И я готова согласиться с его домоправительницей, что, хотя некоторые люди и считают его гордецом, сама я этого совсем не почувствовала.</p>
<p>— Особенно меня удивило его гостеприимство. По отношению к нам он был не просто вежливым, но, я бы сказал, подчеркнуто внимательным. А ведь для подобного внимания у него не было никакого повода: его знакомство с Элизабет было самым поверхностным.</p>
<p>— Разумеется, Лиззи, он уступает Уикхему, — добавила тетушка. — Вернее, у него не такая привлекательная внешность, хотя он совсем недурен. Но почему ты нам описала его таким чудовищем?</p>
<p>Элизабет оправдывалась как могла: она говорила, что он понравился ей гораздо больше, когда они встретились в Кенте, и что еще никогда он не казался ей столь приятным человеком, каким предстал перед ними в это утро.</p>
<p>— Возможно, он несколько взбалмошен, — заметил мистер Гардинер. — Этим вашим великим людям свойственна такая особенность. А потому я не собираюсь воспользоваться приглашением насчет рыбной ловли. Не то вдруг у него переменится настроение и мне придется убираться восвояси.</p>
<p>Элизабет видела, что они совершенно не разобрались в его характере, но не сказала ни слова.</p>
<p>— Посмотрев на него, — продолжала миссис Гардинер, — я бы никогда не подумала, что он способен обойтись с кем-нибудь так жестоко, как обошелся с бедным Уикхемом. Он вовсе не кажется злодеем, напротив, когда он разговаривает, у него около рта видны такие добрые складки. В его внешности чувствуется какое-то достоинство, с которым никак не вяжется представление о жестокости. А как горячо расхваливала его характер почтенная женщина, показывавшая нам дом! Я иногда еле удерживала улыбку. Должно быть, он щедрый хозяин и в глазах прислуги благодаря этому выглядит добродетельным во всех отношениях.</p>
<p>Элизабет почувствовала необходимость как-то оправдать его обращение с Уикхемом. И, соблюдая предельную осторожность, она объяснила им, что, по полученным от его родных сведениям, отношения Дарси с этим молодым человеком могли быть истолкованы совсем по-другому. Характер первого оказывался при этом не столь испорченным, а второго — не столь безупречным, как им представлялось в Хартфордшире. В подтверждение она изложила подробности связывавшей их злосчастной истории, не сказав, от кого она о ней узнала, но заверив, что на достоверность полученных ею сведений можно положиться.</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер была поражена и опечалена. Но так как в это время они уже въехали в городок, в котором она провела свою юность, ее слишком часто стали отвлекать от разговора приятные воспоминания. То и дело показывая мужу памятные для нее места, она уже была не в состоянии думать о чем-то другом. И, несмотря на усталость от утренней прогулки, они сразу после обеда снова покинули гостиницу, чтобы навестить старых друзей, с которыми так приятно было провести вечер после многолетней разлуки.</p>
<p>События дня слишком взволновали Элизабет, чтобы она могла уделить много внимания новым знакомствам. И на протяжении вечера она была поглощена своими мыслями, удивляясь дружескому тону мистера Дарси, а еще больше — его намерению познакомить с ней свою сестру.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА II</p>
</div>
<p>Элизабет полагала, что мистер Дарси и его сестра навестят их на следующий день после приезда мисс Дарси. И она решила в первую половину этого дня не отлучаться надолго из гостиницы. Но ее расчет оказался неверным — визит состоялся в то же утро, когда мисс Дарси прибыла в Пемберли. Совершив прогулку по окрестностям вместе со своими новыми друзьями, Гардинеры и Элизабет вернулись в гостиницу, чтобы переодеться и затем пообедать в той же компании, когда их внимание привлек шум экипажа, и они увидели в окно мужчину и молодую девушку, приближавшихся в открытой коляске. Элизабет сразу узнала ливреи, сообразила, кто находится в экипаже, и повергла дядюшку и тетушку в немалое изумление известием об ожидающей их чести. Гардинеры были в самом деле ошеломлены. А смущенный вид племянницы, так же, как и сообщенная ею новость, вместе со всеми событиями предыдущего дня, заставили их по-новому взглянуть на все обстоятельства. И хотя прежде подобное предположение не могло бы у них даже возникнуть, в этот момент им стало ясно, что столь большое внимание со стороны таких особ не может объясняться иначе, как склонностью мистера Дарси к Элизабет. Пока эта только что зародившаяся догадка укрепилась в их сознании, смятение племянницы возросло еще больше. Она сама поражалась своей нервозности. Кроме других поводов для беспокойства, ее особенно тревожило, как бы мистер Дарси под действием своего увлечения не слишком перехвалил ее своей сестре. И, больше обычного горя желанием встретить гостей возможно приветливее, она справедливо опасалась, что всякая способность казаться приветливой может на этот раз ей изменить. Не желая быть замеченной с улицы, она отошла от окна и постаралась успокоиться, прохаживаясь по комнате. Однако несколько брошенных на нее недоумевающих взглядов тетушки и дядюшки привели ее чувства в еще большее расстройство.</p>
<p>Мисс Дарси и ее брат вошли в комнату, и вызывавшее столько страхов знакомство наконец состоялось. Элизабет с изумлением обнаружила, что ее новая подруга смущена нисколько не меньше ее самой. За время своего пребывания в Лэмтоне она уже не раз слышала о чрезмерной гордости мисс Дарси. Однако несколько минут наблюдений убедили Элизабет в том, что эта молодая особа была просто чрезмерно застенчивой. Элизабет с трудом удавалось заставить ее произнести какое-нибудь слово, кроме едва слышных односложных ответов.</p>
<p>Мисс Дарси была высокого роста, намного выше Элизабет. Несмотря на свои шестнадцать лет, она уже вполне сформировалась и казалась женственной и мягкой. У нее были не такие правильные, как у ее брата, черты лица, но ее внешность и манеры свидетельствовали об уме, доброте и деликатности. Ожидавшая найти в ней такого же проницательного и неуязвимого наблюдателя человеческих нравов, как мистер Дарси, Элизабет с удовольствием отметила про себя, насколько брат и сестра были непохожи друг на друга.</p>
<p>Прошло короткое время после их появления, когда мистер Дарси сказал, что ее также собирается навестить мистер Бингли. И едва она успела выразить по этому поводу свое удовольствие и приготовиться к встрече нового гостя, как на лестнице послышались быстрые шаги и через минуту он вошел в комнату. Гнев Элизабет против молодого человека давно прошел. Но если бы в ней и сохранилась малейшая доля этого гнева, она сразу бы исчезла при виде его непритворной радости от их встречи. Бингли горячо расспрашивал о здоровье ее родных, никого, правда, не называя по имени. При этом он держался и разговаривал с добродушием и сердечностью, которые отличали его при встречах в Хартфордшире.</p>
<p>У Гардинеров Бингли вызвал не меньший интерес, чем у Элизабет, — им давно хотелось его увидеть. И они смотрели на пришедших во все глаза. Недавно возникшее подозрение относительно склонности мистера Дарси к их племяннице побуждало их к внимательному, хотя и осторожному наблюдению за ними обоими. И это наблюдение вскоре убедило их, что, по крайней мере, у молодого человека сердце задето вполне серьезно. Чувства девицы еще оставляли некоторое сомнение, но восторженное преклонение перед ней ее кавалера казалось бесспорным.</p>
<p>Элизабет, в свою очередь, была чрезвычайно занята. Ей нужно было разобраться в мыслях гостей, привести в порядок свои собственные и постараться быть приятной присутствующим. И хотя больше всего она тревожилась о последнем, здесь успех ей <em>был</em> обеспечен особенно надежно благодаря расположению всех, кому она старалась понравиться. Бингли проявил полную готовность, Джорджиана — искреннее желание, а Дарси — самое твердое намерение вынести о ней благоприятное суждение.</p>
<p>При виде Бингли мысли Элизабет, естественно, обратились к Джейн. И она жаждала узнать, думает ли он о том же. Иногда ей казалось, что, по сравнению с прежними временами, он стал менее разговорчивым, и раз или два ей почудилось, будто он искал некое сходство в ее чертах. Но если все это и могло оставаться лишь плодом ее фантазии, она не могла ошибиться в оценке его отношения к мисс Дарси, которую ей когда-то описали как соперницу Джейн. С обеих сторон она не подметила ни одного взгляда, который бы говорил об их особом взаимном расположении. Нельзя было заметить ничего, что подтвердило бы надежды мисс Бингли, и вскоре она почувствовала себя совершенно спокойной по этому поводу. А две или три черточки в его поведении, замеченные ею прежде, чем они расстались, подсказали ее склонному к такому выводу воображению, что Бингли вспоминает о ее сестре не без нежности и охотно заговорил бы о ней, если бы у него хватило на это духа. Когда все остальные были увлечены беседой, Бингли с оттенком искренней грусти сказал:</p>
<p>— Сколько времени утекло с тех пор, как я имел удовольствие с вами встречаться! — И прежде, чем она успела ответить, добавил: — Больше восьми месяцев! Ведь мы не виделись с двадцать шестого ноября — с того самого вечера, когда мы танцевали в Незерфилде!</p>
<p>Элизабет с радостью отметила про себя, как точно запомнил он эту дату. А немного погодя он улучил минуту и незаметно для других спросил, все ли ее сестры находятся в Лонгборне. Ни этот вопрос, ни предыдущее замечание сами по себе не содержали слишком многого, но им придавали значение лицо и манеры говорившего.</p>
<p>Ей редко удавалось взглянуть в сторону мистера Дарси. Но каждый раз, когда она могла бросить на него взор, она видела на его лице самое приветливое выражение. Во всем, что он говорил, ни в малейшей степени не чувствовалось высокомерия или заносчивости по отношению к его собеседникам. Это доказывало, что замеченное ею вчера улучшение его манер, даже если оно и было кратковременным, по крайней мере, длится более одного дня. Наблюдая за тем, как он стремится расположить к себе и заслужить доброе мнение людей, всякое общение с которыми несколько месяцев тому назад считал бы для себя унизительным, видя, как он любезен не только по отношению к ней самой, но и к той самой ее родне, о которой рассуждал с таким откровенным презрением, и, вспоминая их резкий разговор в Хансфорде, она отмечала в нем столь значительную, столь бросающуюся в глаза перемену, что чуть ли не выказывала открыто свое изумление. Даже в обществе своих дорогих друзей в Незерфилде или высокопоставленных родственников в Розингсе он еще никогда не был столь исполнен желания быть приятным своим собеседникам, не был так свободен от надменности и замкнутости. И это при том, что ему здесь вовсе не из-за чего было стараться, а самое знакомство с людьми, которым он сейчас уделял внимание, могло навлечь на него одни только упреки и насмешки со стороны незерфилдских и розингских дам!</p>
<p>Гости пробыли у них около получаса. Перед уходом мистер Дарси напомнил сестре, что они собирались пригласить мистера и миссис Гардинер и мисс Беннет на обед в Пемберли, прежде чем они покинут эти места. С некоторой неловкостью, объяснявшейся тем, что она еще не привыкла к роли хозяйки дома, мисс Дарси от души поддержала своего брата. Миссис Гардинер бросила взгляд на Элизабет, желая узнать, насколько ее племянница, к которой главным образом относилось приглашение, готова его принять. Но Элизабет в этот момент отвернулась. Такое нарочитое безразличие свидетельствовало скорее о ее смущении, нежели о том, что она хочет от приглашения уклониться. Поэтому, видя, что ее муж, который был в восторге от нового знакомства, смотрит на него благосклонно, она взяла на себя смелость условиться, что они приедут в Пемберли послезавтра.</p>
<p>Возможность еще раз встретиться с мисс Беннет, а также подольше побеседовать с ней о хартфордширских друзьях была принята Бингли с большой радостью. В представлении довольной этим Элизабет это означало, что он надеется поговорить с ней о Джейн. Последнее обстоятельство, как и некоторые другие, позволило ей после ухода гостей считать, что она провела истекшие полчаса не так уж плохо, хотя в их присутствии она едва ли испытывала удовольствие. Стремясь остаться одна и опасаясь расспросов и намеков со стороны дядюшки и тетушки, она пробыла с ними ровно столько, сколько требовалось, чтобы выслушать их доброжелательный отзыв о мистере Бингли, и убежала переодеваться.</p>
<p>Однако любопытство Гардинеров ей вовсе не угрожало. В их намерения не входило принуждать ее к откровенности. Было ясно, что их племянница гораздо ближе знакома с мистером Дарси, чем они могли предполагать. Нельзя было сомневаться, что он в нее серьезно влюблен. Но чем больше им хотелось узнать, тем меньше видели они оправданий для расспросов.</p>
<p>О мистере Дарси следовало теперь думать благоприятно. И в той мере, в какой позволяло их знакомство, они в самом деле не замечали за ним никаких недостатков. Их не могла не тронуть его любезность. И если бы, оценивая его характер, они могли, не считаясь с прочими мнениями, основываться только на собственных чувствах или на отзыве его домоправительницы, в составленном ими образе хартфордширское общество едва ли смогло бы узнать своего прежнего знакомца. Им хотелось верить миссис Рейнолдс. И они легко пришли к заключению, что свидетельство домоправительницы, знавшей своего патрона с четырехлетнего возраста и внушавшей достаточное доверие, отнюдь не стоило отвергать с излишней поспешностью. Сведения, которыми располагали их лэмтонские друзья, ничем существенным этого свидетельства не опровергали. Мистера Дарси могли упрекнуть только в гордости. Возможно, что гордость и в самом деле была ему свойственна. Но даже если бы это было не так, жители небольшого городка, в котором владелец поместья не имел близких друзей, вполне могли приписать ему этот недостаток. Вместе с тем его характеризовали как человека щедрого, оказывающего широкую помощь нуждающимся.</p>
<p>В отношении Уикхема путешественникам вскоре стало известно, что он пользовался здесь незавидной репутацией. И если истинную причину разлада Уикхема с сыном его покровителя истолковывали вкривь и вкось, все же не подлежало сомнению, что, покидая Дербишир, молодой человек оставил уйму долгов, которые позже были уплачены мистером Дарси.</p>
<p>Что касается Элизабет, то в этот вечер ее мысли были еще больше сосредоточены на Пемберли, чем в предыдущий. И хотя вечер тянулся, как ей казалось, весьма медленно, его все же не хватило на то, чтобы она успела определить свое отношение к одному из обитателей этого поместья. Более двух часов Элизабет не могла заснуть, стараясь привести свои мысли в порядок. Она явно не относилась к нему с ненавистью. Нет, ненависть исчезла несколько месяцев тому назад. И почти столько же времени она стыдилась того, что когда-то испытывала к нему предубеждение, которое принимала за ненависть. Невольно возникшее уважение к Дарси, вызванное признанием его положительных качеств, больше не противоречило ее чувствам. И оно приобрело более теплый оттенок благодаря его поведению в эти два дня, представившему его характер в еще более выгодном свете. Но громче всех голосов, громче уважения и одобрения в пользу Дарси в ее душе говорил еще один голос, к которому нельзя было не прислушаться. Это была благодарность. Благодарность не только за его прежнее чувство, но и за то, что он еще продолжал ее так сильно любить, простив ей злобные и несправедливые упреки, которые она высказала, отвергая его предложение. Дарси, который, по ее убеждению, должен был отвернуться от нее, как от лютого врага, постарался при этой случайной встрече сделать все возможное, чтобы сохранить их знакомство. Не позволяя себе подчеркивать свою склонность и избегая в поведении всякой вычурности, он стремился заслужить доброе мнение о себе ее родных и сблизить ее со своей сестрой. Подобная перемена в столь самолюбивом человеке вызывала не только удивление, но и чувство признательности, ибо она могла объясняться только любовью, горячей любовью. И эта любовь пробуждала в Элизабет ощущение пока неясное, ждущее своего развития, однако отнюдь не неприятное. Она уважала и ценила этого человека, была ему благодарна, искренне желала ему счастья. И ей только важно было понять, хочет ли она сама, чтобы его судьба оказалась связанной с ее собственной, и будет ли она способствовать их общему счастью, если, используя имеющуюся у нее, как ей подсказывала интуиция, власть, заставит его вновь просить ее руки.</p>
<p>Между теткой и племянницей в тот же вечер было условлено, что исключительное внимание, которое оказала им мисс Дарси, навестив их в самое утро своего приезда в Пемберли, заслуживает, пусть даже не равной, ответной любезности. Было решено поэтому нанести ей визит в первой половине следующего дня. Итак, им предстояло туда поехать. Элизабет это было приятно, хотя едва ли она сама могла бы себе объяснить, чему же, собственно говоря, она радуется.</p>
<p>Мистер Гардинер покинул их вскоре после завтрака. Повторенное накануне приглашение половить в Пемберли рыбу требовало, чтобы он встретился там с некоторыми людьми, ожидавшими его около полудня.</p>
<p></span><span id="id48"></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА III</p>
</div>
<p>Хорошо зная, что неприязнь к ней мисс Бингли вызвана ревностью, Элизабет понимала, что эта особа будет в высшей степени раздосадована ее появлением в Пемберли. Было поэтому любопытно узнать, сможет ли она вести себя достаточно учтиво при возобновлении их знакомства.</p>
<p>По прибытии их пригласили в гостиную, выходившую окнами на север, в которой было приятно провести время в жаркие летние часы. Из окон открывался живописный вид на возвышавшиеся невдалеке лесистые холмы, а также прилегавшую к дому зеленую лужайку, на которой росли великолепные дубы и испанские каштаны.</p>
<p>В этой комнате они были приняты мисс Дарси, находившейся в обществе миссис Хёрст, мисс Бингли и дамы, вместе с которой она жила в Лондоне. Джорджиана встретила их очень любезно. Однако вследствие ее застенчивости и боязни совершить какой-нибудь промах, в поведении Джорджианы чувствовалась скованность, которую люди, смотревшие на нее снизу вверх, легко могли приписать замкнутости и гордости. Миссис Гардинер и ее племянница поняли ее состояние и испытывали к ней сочувствие.</p>
<p>Миссис Хёрст и мисс Бингли приветствовали их только легкими поклонами. Когда все уселись, воцарилось обычное в таких случаях молчание. Его нарушила миссис Энсли, обходительная, приятного вида женщина, которая своей попыткой завязать беседу доказала, что она умеет себя вести лучше остальных обитательниц этого дома. В разговоре между нею и миссис Гардинер изредка участвовала и Элизабет. А выражение лица мисс Дарси свидетельствовало, что ей бы очень хотелось собраться с духом и тоже к нему присоединиться. И в минуты, когда она меньше всего боялась, что ее кто-нибудь услышит, она и в самом деле вставляла короткие фразы.</p>
<p>Элизабет вскоре заметила, что мисс Бингли пристально за ней наблюдает, особенно следя за каждым ее словом, обращенным к мисс Дарси. Несмотря на это, она все же постаралась бы побеседовать с Джорджианой, если бы сидела к ней поближе. Однако, будучи поглощена собственными мыслями, она была довольна, что ей не приходится много разговаривать. С каждой минутой можно было ждать появления мужчин. Ей хотелось и вместе с тем не хотелось, чтобы в их числе оказался хозяин дома, причем едва ли она могла бы определить, какое из двух желаний было сильнее. После того как они просидели так около пятнадцати минут, в течение которых Элизабет ни разу не слышала голоса мисс Бингли, последняя прервала ее размышления, осведомившись у нее о здоровье ее родных. Элизабет ответила столь же кратко и сдержанно, и мисс Бингли замолчала.</p>
<p>Некоторое разнообразие внесло появление слуги с холодным мясом, печеньем и превосходнейшими фруктами, такими разнообразными в эту пору года. Случилось это, правда, после того, как миссис Энсли сумела многозначительными взглядами и улыбками напомнить молодой хозяйке о ее обязанностях. Теперь для компании нашлось общее занятие, ибо, если не все могли между собой разговаривать, есть был способен каждый. И живописные пирамиды персиков, винограда и слив вскоре привлекли всех к столу.</p>
<p>Подобное времяпрепровождение давало Элизабет полную возможность разобраться, хочется ли ей, чтобы к их обществу присоединился мистер Дарси. И за минуту до его появления ей казалось, что она решила этот вопрос утвердительно. Тем не менее, когда он вошел, она сразу склонилась к противоположному выводу.</p>
<p>Мистер Дарси провел некоторое время в обществе мистера Гардинера, который вместе с двумя-тремя местными жителями ловил рыбу. Услышав от него, что его жена и племянница хотели нанести утренний визит Джорджиане, Дарси поспешил домой.</p>
<p>Как только он появился, Элизабет вполне здраво рассудила, что ей следует держаться при нем свободно и непринужденно. Учитывая вызванное ими всеобщее подозрение и неусыпный надзор за каждым его шагом, решение это было безусловно правильным, хоть и не легко выполнимым. Но ничье любопытство не обнаруживалось так явно, как любопытство, написанное на лице мисс Бингли, хотя она и таяла от улыбок каждый раз, когда заговаривала с Дарси или Элизабет. Ибо ревность не лишила ее надежд и она ничуть не ослабила своего внимания к владельцу Пемберли. Мисс Дарси после его прихода старалась вступать в разговор несколько чаще, и Элизабет заметила явное стремление ее брата поближе познакомить ее с Джорджианой и содействовать их попыткам завязать беседу. Это не ускользнуло и от внимания мисс Бингли, которая со свойственной раздраженному человеку неосмотрительностью воспользовалась первым же случаем, чтобы насмешливо-любезным тоном спросить:</p>
<p>— Кстати, мисс Элиза, правда ли, что ***ширский полк в самом деле покинул Меритон? Для вашей семьи это было, наверно, подлинной трагедией!</p>
<p>В присутствии Дарси она не смела произнести фамилию Уикхем. Но Элизабет сразу поняла, что она намекала на него, и разнообразные воспоминания, связанные с этим именем, причинили ей некоторую досаду. Готовая дать отпор злостному выпаду, она тем не менее ответила на вопрос с достаточным безразличием. Невольно брошенный ею при этом взгляд позволил ей заметить, с каким вниманием посмотрел на нее покрасневший мистер Дарси и в каком смущении находилась не смевшая поднять глаза Джорджиана. Если бы мисс Бингли знала, какую боль она причиняет этим намеком своей любимой подруге, она, безусловно, остереглась бы его высказать. Но она хотела только уязвить Элизабет, намекнув ей о человеке, к которому она, по ее мнению, была неравнодушна. Рассчитывая вывести гостью из равновесия напоминанием о связанном с этим полком легкомысленном и глупом поведении ее родных, она надеялась повредить Элизабет в глазах Дарси. О готовившемся побеге мисс Дарси она не имела понятия — об этом не знал никто, кроме Элизабет. От семьи Бингли это происшествие скрывалось особенно тщательно из-за тех самых намерений мистера Дарси, которые заподозрила у него Элизабет и при осуществлении которых родня Бингли могла стать родней Джорджианы. У Дарси в самом деле когда-то существовал подобный план, и, не объясняя этим планом стремление разлучить Бингли и Джейн, можно было допустить, что он все же усилил его живой интерес к благополучию друга.</p>
<p>Умение Элизабет владеть собой вскоре рассеяло его беспокойство. И, так как раздосадованная и разочарованная мисс Бингли не посмела напомнить об Уикхеме более прямым образом, Джорджиана со временем также пришла в себя, хотя и не настолько, чтобы снова принять участие в беседе. Мистер Дарси, с которым она боялась встретиться взглядом, едва ли заметил ее переживания.</p>
<p>А повод, который должен был по замыслу мисс Бингли оттолкнуть его от Элизабет, по-видимому, напротив, заставил его думать о ней еще более благосклонно.</p>
<p>Вскоре после упомянутых вопроса и ответа гости уехали. И, пока мистер Дарси провожал их до экипажа, Кэролайн изливала свои чувства, обсуждая внешность, поведение и платье Элизабет Беннет. Джорджиана, однако, к ней не присоединилась. Рекомендации брата было достаточно, чтобы обеспечить любому человеку ее расположение. Его суждение не могло быть ошибочным, а он отзывался об Элизабет с такой теплотой, что Джорджиана не могла не находить ее красивой и милой. Когда он вернулся в гостиную, мисс Бингли не удержалась от того, чтобы не повторить некоторые свои замечания по адресу Элизабет, которые она только что высказывала его сестре.</p>
<p>— Как плохо выглядела сегодня Элиза Беннет, не правда ли, мистер Дарси? — воскликнула Кэролайн. — Я в жизни не видела, чтобы кто-нибудь так изменился за полгода! Она ужасно погрубела и подурнела! Мы с Луизой считаем, что, попадись она где-нибудь нам на улице, мы бы ее просто не узнали!</p>
<p>Хотя эти рассуждения отнюдь не понравились мистеру Дарси, он ограничился лишь сдержанным ответом, сказав, что не заметил в лице Элизабет никаких перемен, кроме загара — естественного следствия путешествия в летнюю пору.</p>
<p>— Что касается меня, — добавила мисс Бингли, — я, признаюсь, никогда не замечала в ней ничего привлекательного. Лицо у нее слишком узкое, кожа темная, а черты самые невзрачные. Ну какой у нее нос? Ни лепки, ни выразительности. Губы терпимые, но такие заурядные. А в ее глазах — кто-то однажды даже назвал их очаровательными? — я никогда не находила ничего особенного. Их едкий, пронизывающий взгляд вызывает у меня отвращение. Во всем ее облике столько простонародного самодовольства, с которым невозможно примириться!</p>
<p>Так как мисс Бингли знала, что Элизабет нравится мистеру Дарси, она могла бы сообразить, что высказывания подобного рода едва ли откроют ей кратчайший путь к его сердцу. Но рассерженные люди не всегда руководствуются здравым смыслом. И выражение досады на его лице было единственным следствием ее маневров. Тем не менее Дарси хранил молчание. Стремясь вызвать его на разговор, она продолжала:</p>
<p>— Помнится, когда мы впервые встретились с ней в Хартфордшире, всех нас крайне удивило, что она прослыла красоткой. Мне врезались в память слова, сказанные вами после того, как Беннеты обедали у нас в Незерфилде: «Это она-то красотка? Я бы скорее назвал ее мамашу душой общества!» Впоследствии, правда, ей, кажется, удалось снискать ваше расположение — одно время вы даже находили ее хорошенькой.</p>
<p>— О да, — выйдя из себя, ответил Дарси. — Это было в самом начале нашего знакомства. Но прошло уже много месяцев, как я стал видеть в ней одну из самых прелестных женщин, которых мне приходилось встречать.</p>
<p>С этими словами он вышел, предоставив мисс Бингли удовольствоваться вырванным признанием, которое ранило только ее одну.</p>
<p>На обратном пути миссис Гардинер и Элизабет обсудили все подробности визита, не коснувшись только того, что интересовало обеих на самом деле. Они затронули внешность и поведение всех присутствовавших, кроме человека, который больше всего привлекал их внимание, — говорили о его сестре, его друзьях, его доме, его угощении — обо всем, кроме него самого. А между тем Элизабет очень хотелось услышать мнение своей тетки о мистере Дарси, а та была бы крайне обрадована, если бы ее племянница решилась о нем упомянуть.</p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА IV</p>
</div>
<p>Элизабет почувствовала сильное разочарование, не найдя по приезде в Лэмтон письма от Джейн. То же повторилось на второй и третий день их пребывания в этом городке. Но на утро четвертого дня ее огорчениям пришел конец, и сестра ее была полностью оправдана. Для Элизабет одновременно пришли два письма, из которых одно имело штемпель, свидетельствовавший, что его послали по неверной дороге. Этому не следовало удивляться, так как почерк Джейн на конверте был чрезвычайно неразборчив.</p>
<p>Письма были принесены как раз тогда, когда Гардинеры приглашали ее на прогулку. Теперь они решили пойти вдвоем, предоставив ей возможность насладиться чтением в одиночестве. Прежде всего следовало прочесть заблудившееся письмо, отправленное еще пять дней тому назад. Начало его состояло из обычных сведений о визитах, небольших вечеринках и тому подобных новостях провинциальной жизни. Вторая половина, датированная следующим днем, касалась значительно более важного события и была написана с явной поспешностью. В ней заключалось следующее сообщение:</p>
<p>«Начало этого письма уже было написано, дорогая Лиззи, когда случилось неожиданное и очень серьезное происшествие. Но мне не хотелось бы тебя пугать, — пожалуйста, не волнуйся, — мы все здоровы. Новость, которую я должна тебе сообщить, касается бедной Лидии. Письмо с нарочным, прибывшим из Лондона от полковника Форстера вчера в полночь, когда все уже укладывались спать, известило нас, что Лидия уехала в Шотландию вместе с одним из офицеров — короче говоря, с Уикхемом! Представь себе наше изумление. Впрочем, для Китти эта новость не была столь неожиданной. Я очень, очень огорчена. Такой неблагоразумный брак для обоих! Но я надеюсь на лучшее — быть может, об этом молодом человеке судят неправильно. В его безрассудство и легкомыслие я готова поверить. Но теперешний его поступок (и нам следует этому радоваться!) отнюдь не порочит его сердца. По крайней мере, в его выборе нет расчета — он же знает, что отец не может дать за ней ровно ничего. Бедная мама просто в отчаянии. Папа держится несколько лучше. Как хорошо мы сделали, скрыв от них то, что нам про него рассказывали! Мы и сами должны об этом теперь забыть. Предполагается, что они выехали в субботу около полуночи, но их отсутствие заметили только вчера в восемь часов утра. Нарочный был послан немедленно. Лиззи, дорогая, они должны были проехать всего в десяти милях от нашего дома! Судя по письму, мы надеемся, что полковник Форстер скоро будет здесь. Лидия оставила несколько строк его жене, сообщив ей об их намерении. Больше писать не могу — бедная мама не в состоянии долго оставаться одна. Боюсь, тебе трудно будет во всем разобраться — я даже сама не знаю, что написала».</p>
<p>Не оставляя времени для раздумий и едва отдавая себе отчет в своих чувствах, Элизабет, закончив это письмо, сразу схватила второе и, распечатав его с крайним нетерпением, прочла следующие строки (письмо было написано на другой день после предыдущего):</p>
<p>«К этому моменту, дорогая сестра, ты уже должна была получить мое написанное наспех вчерашнее сообщение. Хотелось бы, чтобы новое письмо оказалось более вразумительным. Но, хотя сейчас я уже не столь стеснена во времени, в моей голове такой сумбур, что я не могу быть уверена, все ли в нем будет понятно. Лиззи, миленькая, я даже не знаю, как мне об этом написать, но у меня для тебя плохие вести, и я должна сообщить их тебе как можно скорее. Как бы ни был неразумен брак между мистером Уикхемом и нашей бедной Лидией, мы теперь больше всего хотели бы убедиться, что он состоялся. Ибо имеется слишком много оснований подозревать, что они вовсе не уехали в Шотландию. Вчера к нам прибыл полковник Форстер, который покинул Брайтон накануне, через несколько часов после отъезда нарочного. Из короткого письма Лидии к мисс Ф., казалось бы, следовало, что они отправились в Гретна-Грин<a href="#ref8" class="a" onclick="save();">[32]</a>. Однако мистер Денни выразил кому-то свое убеждение, что У. совсем туда и не собирался и вообще не думал жениться на Лидии. Это передали полковнику Ф., который, тут же подняв тревогу, помчался из Б., с тем чтобы разузнать, каким путем они ехали. Он легко проследил их путь до Клэпхема, но потом след потерялся, так как, прибыв туда, они сошли с почтовой кареты, везшей их от Эпсома<a href="#ref7" class="a" onclick="save();">[33]</a>, и наняли извозчика. Дальше известно только, что они продолжали свой путь по лондонской дороге. Просто не знаю, что и подумать. Наведя всевозможные справки по эту сторону Лондона, полковник Ф. прибыл в Хартфордшир, настойчиво продолжая расспросы у каждого шлагбаума и в гостиницах Барнета и Хэтфилда<a href="#ref6" class="a" onclick="save();">[34]</a>, но так ничего и не добился, — беглецов, которых он разыскивал, никто не видел. Глубоко опечаленный, он прибыл в Лонгборн и поделился с нами своими опасениями. Это делает честь его сердцу. Мне так искренне жаль его и миссис Ф., — их решительно не в чем упрекнуть. Мы все, дорогая Лиззи, в очень большом расстройстве. Мама и папа боятся самого худшего, но я не могу подумать об У. так плохо. У них могло быть множество причин для того, чтобы предпочесть первоначальному плану тайную женитьбу в Лондоне. И даже если допустить, что недостойный замысел в отношении девушки из порядочной семьи мог возникнуть у молодого человека, можно ли думать, что она сама потеряла голову в такой степени? Просто невероятно! К моему огорчению, полковник Ф. не очень склонен верить в то, что они обвенчались. Когда я поделилась с ним своими надеждами, он покачал головой и высказал сомнение в том, что У. человек, на которого можно положиться. Бедная мама теперь в самом деле больна и не выходит из комнаты. Ей стало бы легче, если бы она взяла себя в руки, но этого трудно ожидать. Что касается папы, то мне еще не приходилось видеть его таким удрученным. На бедную Китти сердятся за то, что она скрыла привязанность Лидии. Но поскольку ей сообщили об этом доверительно, могла ли она поступить по-другому? Я искренне рада, дорогая Лиззи, что тебе не пришлось присутствовать при этих ужасных сценах. Но сейчас, когда первое потрясение уже прошло, должна ли я признаться, насколько я жажду твоего возвращения? Однако я не так уж эгоистична, чтобы настаивать, если это окажется затруднительным. Adieu. Я снова взялась за перо, чтобы обратиться с просьбой, от которой двумя строчками выше обещала воздержаться. Но обстоятельства таковы, что я вынуждена умолять всех вас приехать как можно скорее. Я настолько хорошо знаю наших дорогих дядю и тетю, чтобы не бояться сказать им об этом, причем к дяде у меня есть и особая просьба. Папа сию минуту уезжает с полковником Форстером в Лондон, чтобы попытаться там найти Лидию. Каким образом он собирается это сделать, мне решительно неизвестно. Но его угнетенное душевное состояние не позволит ему предпринять достаточно осторожные и разумные действия, а полковник Форстер обязан завтра вечером вернуться в Брайтон. В таком крайнем положении дядины советы и помощь могли бы оказаться спасительными. Он сразу поймет мои переживания, и я полагаюсь на его отзывчивость».</p>
<p>— Но где же, где же мне найти дядю?! — вскочив с места, воскликнула Элизабет, как только дочитала письмо.</p>
<p>Ей хотелось немедленно, не теряя драгоценных минут, броситься за мистером Гардинером. Но когда она добежала до порога, дверь распахнулась и слуга пропустил в комнату мистера Дарси. Увидев, как она побледнела и как стремительно кинулась ему навстречу, он растерялся. И прежде чем он привел мысли в порядок, чтобы что-то сказать, Элизабет, в сознании которой решительно все было заслонено судьбой Лидии, поспешно проговорила:</p>
<p>— Извините меня, я вынуждена вас покинуть. Мне сейчас же надо найти мистера Гардинера по неотложному делу. Нельзя терять ни секунды.</p>
<p>— Боже мой, что случилось? — вскричал он скорее участливо, нежели сообразуясь с правилами приличия. Однако, тут же взяв себя в руки, добавил: — Конечно, я не смею вас задерживать. Но разрешите отыскать мистера и миссис Гардинер мне или кому-нибудь из слуг. Вам может стать дурно, вы не в состоянии сами пойти на поиски.</p>
<p>Элизабет хотела было настоять на своем, но, почувствовав слабость в ногах, поняла, что едва ли способна догнать Гардинеров. Поэтому, снова позвав слугу, она, с трудом выговаривая от волнения слова, поручила ему разыскать хозяина и хозяйку и попросить их немедленно вернуться в гостиницу.</p>
<p>Когда слуга вышел, Элизабет, будучи не в силах стоять на ногах, опустилась в кресло. При этом вид у нее был такой больной, что Дарси счел невозможным ее покинуть и не мог удержаться от выражения участия и заботы:</p>
<p>— Может быть, позвать горничную? Вам надо выпить чего-нибудь подкрепляющего. Стакан вина, например, — позвольте, я вам налью? Вам очень нездоровится!</p>
<p>— Нет, нет, благодарю вас, — ответила она, стараясь сдержать свое волнение. — Со мной ничего не случилось. Я совершенно здорова. Меня лишь расстроило только что полученное злосчастное известие из Лонгборна.</p>
<p>При этом она разразилась рыданиями и в течение нескольких минут была не в силах что-нибудь сказать. Дарси в растерянности мог только пробормотать невразумительные слова сочувствия и молча смотрел на нее с жалостью. В конце концов она снова заговорила:</p>
<p>— Я только что получила письмо от Джейн с огорчительной новостью. Она станет известна всем. Моя младшая сестра покинула друзей — сбежала, — оказалась во власти мистера… мистера Уикхема. Они вместе уехали из Брайтона. Вы достаточно знаете этого человека, чтобы понимать, что это означает. У нее нет ни денег, ни связей, — ровно ничего, чем она могла бы его удержать, — она погибла.</p>
<p>Дарси оцепенел от изумления.</p>
<p>— Страшно подумать, — продолжала она еще более взволнованно, — ведь мне это было так просто предупредить. Я, которая так хорошо знала, что он собой представляет! Достаточно было рассказать моим близким совсем немного из того, что мне стало известно. Этого бы не случилось, если бы все знали, что он за человек. Но теперь уже ничего, ничего нельзя поделать!</p>
<p>— Какой ужас! — воскликнул Дарси. — Я, в самом деле, глубоко огорчен. Но уверены ли вы, что все произошло так, как вы рассказываете? Достоверно ли это известие?</p>
<p>— Увы, да! Они выехали вдвоем из Брайтона в ночь под воскресенье. Их путь удалось проследить до самого Лондона, но дальше он затерялся. То, что они не поехали в Шотландию, — очевидно.</p>
<p>— Но что же предпринято? Пытались ли ее хоть как-то вернуть?</p>
<p>— Отец выехал в Лондон. Джейн просит в письме, чтобы дядя поспешил ему на помощь. Через полчаса мы, наверно, будем в пути. Но ничего не получится. Я хорошо понимаю, что теперь уже ничего не получится. Разве на такого человека можно воздействовать? Каким образом удастся их хотя бы найти? Я ни на что не надеюсь. Все просто ужасно!</p>
<p>Дарси молча наклонил голову, выражая согласие.</p>
<p>— А ведь мне на него открыли глаза! Если бы я тогда знала, что я <em>могла,</em> нет, что я была <em>обязана</em> предпринять! Но я не понимала — боялась зайти слишком далеко. Страшная, непоправимая ошибка!</p>
<p>Дарси ничего не ответил. Возможно, что, прохаживаясь по комнате, погруженный в печальные размышления, он даже не слышал ее слов. На лбу его прорезались глубокие морщины, он был мрачен. Элизабет вскоре обратила на него внимание и сейчас же все поняла. Ее власть над ним кончилась. Все должно было кончиться при таком семейном позоре, при столь явном свидетельстве глубочайшего бесчестия. Ей нечему было удивляться, не в чем его упрекнуть. Но мысль о том, что ему удалось преодолеть свое чувство, ничуть не облегчила ее душевной муки, не ослабила ее горя. Напротив, она как будто явилась тем толчком, который был необходим, чтобы раскрыть ей глаза на собственное сердце. И еще никогда она не сознавала с такой отчетливостью, насколько сильно она могла бы его полюбить, как именно сейчас, в ту самую минуту, когда ни о какой любви между ними больше не могло быть и речи.</p>
<p>И все же, хотя мысли о самой себе и промелькнули в ее сознании, они не могли завладеть им надолго. Унижение, горе, которые всем причинила Лидия, быстро оттеснили все другие переживания. Уткнувшись лицом в платок, Элизабет вскоре забыла обо всем остальном. И только после нескольких минут молчания она вновь стала воспринимать окружающее, прислушавшись к голосу своего собеседника, в словах которого одновременно с участием ощущалось и некоторое замешательство.</p>
<p>— Вы, должно быть, давно ждете моего ухода. Мне нечем оправдать свою медлительность, разве лишь искренним, хоть и бесплодным сочувствием. Боже, если бы только я мог что-то сделать или высказать для смягчения вашего горя! Но для чего надоедать вам пустыми пожеланиями, как будто добиваясь благодарности?.. Боюсь, это печальное событие лишит мою сестру удовольствия видеть вас сегодня в Пемберли?</p>
<p>— О да! Будьте добры извиниться за нас перед мисс Дарси. Скажите ей, что срочное дело потребовало нашего немедленного возвращения. Скрывайте от нее ужасную правду, пока будет возможно. Я понимаю, это продлится недолго.</p>
<p>Он с готовностью обещал блюсти тайну, еще раз выразил ей сочувствие, понадеялся, что все обернется не так плохо, как можно было пока ожидать, и, попросив передать поклон ее родным, удалился, бросив на нее прощальный пристальный взгляд.</p>
<p>Когда он вышел, у Элизабет мелькнула мысль, что они вряд ли когда-нибудь встретятся с той сердечностью, которая отличала их встречи в Дербишире. И, оглянувшись назад на все их знакомство, полное перемен и противоречий, она вздохнула по поводу изменчивости душевных стремлений, которые сейчас были направлены на то, чтобы это знакомство сохранить, а еще недавно — на то, чтобы как можно скорее с ним покончить.</p>
<p>Если уважение и признательность — подходящая почва для сердечной привязанности, то перемена чувств Элизабет не должна казаться невероятной или фальшивой. Но если, напротив, склонность, возникающую на такой основе, считать надуманной или неестественной — в противоположность увлечению, которое якобы так часто рождается с первого взгляда, еще до первых слов, сказанных друг другу будущими влюбленными, — то перемену чувств Элизабет можно оправдать только тем, что у нее уже был небольшой опыт романтической привязанности к Уикхему и что бесславный конец этой привязанности мог подсказать ей иной, менее трогательный путь поисков друга сердца. Как бы то ни было, разлука с Дарси навела ее на грустные размышления. И когда ей пришло в голову, что эта разлука является одним из первых печальных последствий позора ее сестры, боль в ее душе, вызванная поступком Лидии, обострилась еще сильнее. После второго письма Джейн она ни на миг не допускала мысли, что Уикхем может жениться на Лидии. Никто, кроме Джейн, не стал бы, по ее мнению, утешать себя подобной надеждой. Ход событий выглядел достаточно ясным. До тех пор пока она знала содержание лишь первого письма, она недоумевала, как это Уикхем вздумал жениться на девушке, за которой не получал ни гроша. Ей казалось непостижимым, что Лидии удалось привязать его к себе. Но теперь все стало на свои места. Для приключения подобного рода она была достаточно привлекательной. И хотя Элизабет не предполагала, что ее сестра сознательно решилась на побег, не имея в виду замужества, ей не трудно было поверить, что ни добродетель, ни здравый смысл не помешают Лидии стать легкой жертвой своего соблазнителя.</p>
<p>Пока полк стоял в Хартфордшире, Элизабет не замечала, чтобы Лидия проявляла к Уикхему особую склонность. Но она отлично знала, что сестре достаточно самого небольшого поощрения, чтобы броситься на шею кому угодно. Ее избранниками бывали то один, то другой офицер, по мере того как оказанное ей каждым из них внимание поднимало его в ее глазах. Привязанности ее непрерывно менялись, но сердце никогда не оставалось свободным. И этой девчонке было оказано доверие и позволено жить без необходимого присмотра! О, как болезненно отзывалась теперь эта мысль в ее душе!</p>
<p>Она жаждала скорее вернуться домой, чтобы самой все слышать и видеть, во всем принимать участие и делить с Джейн все заботы, обрушившиеся теперь в их расстроенном доме на нее одну, так как мистер Беннет отсутствовал, а мать была не способна вести хозяйство и сама нуждалась в постоянном уходе. Уверенная, что для Лидии ничего уже нельзя сделать, она все же придавала огромное значение вмешательству мистера Гардинера. Поэтому до тех пор, пока он не вошел в комнату, она жестоко страдала от нетерпения. Мистер и миссис Гардинер поспешно вернулись, встревоженные сообщением слуги о внезапной болезни племянницы. Заверив их в том, что она чувствует себя вполне здоровой, Элизабет тотчас же сообщила им причину поднятой ею тревоги, прочитав оба письма вслух и с особым волнением подчеркнув приписку в конце второго письма. Хотя Лидия никогда не была любимицей Гардинеров, их не могло не опечалить полученное известие. Событие наносило ущерб не только ей одной, но решительно всей семье. Поэтому после первых возгласов удивления и негодования мистер Гардинер выразил полную готовность оказать посильную помощь. И хотя Элизабет и не ожидала от него другого ответа, она все же поблагодарила его со слезами на глазах. Охваченные единым порывом, они тотчас же условились обо всем, что касалось поездки. Они должны были отправиться как можно скорее.</p>
<p>— Но что же нам делать с Пемберли! — воскликнула миссис Гардинер. — Джон сказал нам, что мистер Дарси был здесь, когда ты его послала за нами. Это правда?</p>
<p>— Да. И я предупредила его, что мы к ним не сможем приехать. Об этом можно не беспокоиться.</p>
<p>— Можно не беспокоиться? — повторила миссис Гардинер, когда Элизабет убежала к себе собирать вещи. — Неужели отношения между ними позволили ей все ему рассказать? Как бы хотелось мне узнать правду!</p>
<p>Желание это было несбыточным. Оно в лучшем случае могло занять ее ум во время суматошных сборов к отъезду. Если бы Элизабет могла себе позволить быть праздной, она из-за перенесенного удара, несомненно, испытывала бы полное изнеможение. Но ей, как и ее тетке, нужно было еще покончить со множеством дел, в том числе написать друзьям в Лэмтоне, сообщив выдуманную причину внезапного отъезда. Уже через час, однако, все было готово. Мистер Гардинер тем временем заплатил по счету в гостинице, и они могли отправляться. После всех огорчений, пережитых в это утро, и гораздо раньше, чем она предполагала, Элизабет наконец сидела в экипаже, мчавшемся по дороге в Лонгборн.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id50"></span></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА V</p>
</div>
<p>— Я снова все хорошо обдумал, — обратился к Элизабет мистер Гардинер, когда они выехали из городка, — и, рассудив как следует, пожалуй, готов согласиться с Джейн. Мне кажется неправдоподобным, чтобы офицер мог позволить себе столь гнусный поступок в отношении девушки, отнюдь не беззащитной и одинокой, гостившей к тому же в семье его полкового командира. Поэтому я склонен надеяться на лучшее. Не мог же Уикхем полагать, что за нее не вступятся ее друзья? И мог ли он надеяться остаться в полку после того, как нанес такое оскорбление полковнику Форстеру? Соблазн был несоразмерен с риском.</p>
<p>— Вам в самом деле так кажется? — с проблеском надежды спросила Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Честное слово, — сказала миссис Гардинер, — я тоже начинаю склоняться к такому мнению. Слишком это противоречило бы порядочности, чувству чести и его собственной выгоде, чтобы считать Уикхема виновным в подобном поступке. Я не могу о нем думать так плохо. И неужели, Лиззи, он настолько упал в твоих глазах, что ты сама считаешь его на это способным?</p>
<p>— Что касается пренебрежения собственной выгодой — пожалуй, нет. Но всем другим он, по-моему, вполне может пренебречь. Хотелось бы, конечно, чтобы вы были правы! Но, увы, я не смею на это надеяться. В противном случае как объяснить, что они не поехали в Шотландию?</p>
<p>— Прежде всего, — ответил мистер Гардинер, — еще не доказано, что они туда не поехали.</p>
<p>— Да, но их пересадка с почтовой кареты на извозчика кажется весьма подозрительной. К тому же они не оставили никаких следов на барнетской дороге.</p>
<p>— Ну что ж, будем считать, что они в Лондоне. Помимо других причин, они могли заехать туда хотя бы ради того, чтобы избавиться от преследования. У них, должно быть, не слишком много денег. Поэтому разве они не могли подумать о возможности более дешевого, хотя и не столь скорого бракосочетания в городе?</p>
<p>— Но зачем же такая скрытность? Почему они боятся, что их найдут? Для чего тайная женитьба? Нет, нет, мне в это не верится. Его ближайший приятель, судя по письму Джейн, убежден, что он даже не собирался на ней жениться. Уикхем не женится на бесприданнице. Такой роскоши он себе не позволит. И что мог он найти в Лидии? Чем она прельстила его, кроме молодости, здоровья и беспечного нрава, чтобы он пожертвовал ради нее возможностью поправить с помощью женитьбы свои дела? Мне трудно судить, насколько его должна была сдерживать боязнь опозорить военный мундир, ибо я не знаю, к каким это приводит последствиям. Но что касается вашего второго довода, то он не кажется мне убедительным. У Лидии нет братьев, которые могли бы за нее заступиться. А поведение мистера Беннета, его невозмутимость и равнодушие к семейным делам вполне позволяли Уикхему считать, что с его стороны следует ожидать наименьшего вмешательства, какое только возможно в подобном случае.</p>
<p>— Но разве, по-твоему, Лидия могла забыть все, кроме своего увлечения, и согласиться на совместную жизнь, даже не став его законной женой?</p>
<p>— Можно подозревать, — и это ужаснее всего, — ответила Элизабет с глазами, полными слез, — что взгляды сестры на добродетель и мораль отличаются от общепринятых. Мне трудно выразить мою мысль. Может быть, я к ней несправедлива. Но она еще так молода. Ее никогда не учили думать о серьезных вещах. А последние полгода, — нет, уже год, — она не занята ничем, кроме развлечений и суеты. Ей разрешалось жить праздно и легкомысленно и усваивать любые вздорные взгляды, которые она подхватывала где угодно. С тех пор как ***ширский полк расположился в Меритоне, у нее в голове только любовь, ухаживания и офицеры. Раздумывая и болтая об этом, она делала все возможное, чтобы развить в себе наибольшую, — как бы это получше выразиться, — восприимчивость, которая у нее и без того далеко не вялая от природы. А зная умение Уикхема очаровывать своей внешностью и обращением, мы все понимаем, насколько ему легко вскружить женщине голову.</p>
<p>— Да, но ведь Джейн, — заметила ее тетка, — не считает Уикхема настолько плохим человеком, чтобы он был способен соблазнить Лидию.</p>
<p>— О ком Джейн когда-нибудь думала плохо? И найдется ли человек, как бы скверно он себя ни зарекомендовал в прошлом, которого она сочла бы способным соблазнить женщину, не получив доказательств его преступления? Но Джейн знает не хуже меня, что представляет собой Уикхем на самом деле. Нам обеим известно, что он негодяй в полном смысле этого слова. Что у него нет ни чести, ни совести. Что его лживость и неискренность не уступают его вкрадчивости.</p>
<p>— И все это тебе на самом деле известно? — воскликнула миссис Гардинер с вновь пробудившимся любопытством по поводу ее осведомленности.</p>
<p>— Да, я в этом совершенно уверена, — покраснев, сказала Элизабет. — Я уже как-то вам говорила, как низко он поступил по отношению к мистеру Дарси. И вы сами слышали в Лонгборне, что он рассказывал о человеке, проявившем по отношению к нему столько великодушия и терпимости. Но до меня дошли и другие сведения, которых я не вправе… нет, о которых пока что не стоит рассказывать. Клевета, возводимая им на семейство Дарси, не имеет предела. Из того, что он рассказывал мне о мисс Дарси, я представляла ее себе высокомерной, замкнутой и неприятной особой. А ему было известно, что она вовсе не такая. Он должен был знать, что она именно та приветливая и непосредственная девушка, какой мы увидели ее при нашей встрече.</p>
<p>— Но неужели все это ускользнуло от Лидии? Могла ли она совсем не знать того, что Джейн и тебе известно во всех подробностях?</p>
<p>— Увы, да! Именно это и терзает меня сильнее всего. До моего визита в Кент, где я близко познакомилась с мистером Дарси и его родственником, полковником Фицуильямом, я сама ничего не знала. А домой я вернулась перед тем, как ***ширский полк должен был покинуть Меритон. Мы не сочли нужным опровергать перед его уходом сложившееся в наших краях хорошее мнение об Уикхеме. А потому ни я, ни Джейн, которая услышала обо всем от меня, ничего никому не рассказали. Даже когда было решено, что Лидия поедет с миссис Форстер, я не подумала о необходимости раскрыть ей глаза. Мне не приходило в голову, что он способен ее обмануть. А того, что произошло, можете мне поверить, я даже и вообразить не могла.</p>
<p>— Значит, когда они уезжали в Брайтон, у тебя не было причин считать, что они друг к другу неравнодушны?</p>
<p>— Ни малейших. Я не могу припомнить хоть каких-нибудь знаков взаимной симпатии. А вы ведь знаете, если бы что-нибудь можно было заметить, в нашей семье этого бы не проглядели. Когда он поступил в полк, она и впрямь готова была в него влюбиться. Впрочем, тогда мы все были на это способны. Любая девчонка в Меритоне или его окрестностях в течение первых двух месяцев была без ума от Уикхема. Но он совершенно не замечал Лидии. И после нескольких недель безумного увлечения она мало-помалу выбросила его из головы, и ее избранниками снова стали другие офицеры, которые уделяли ей больше внимания.</p>
<p>Разговоры на эту интересную тему, естественно, не добавляли чего-нибудь нового к их страхам, надеждам и предположениям. Однако на всем пути они почти не прекращались. Элизабет была не способна сосредоточиться на чем-то другом. Она жестоко страдала от сознания допущенной ею ошибки и не находила ни минуты забвения или покоя.</p>
<p>Путешественники двигались с предельной скоростью и, проведя ночь в дороге, прибыли в Лонгборн на следующий день к обеду. Мысль, что Джейн не придется долго ждать их приезда, была для Элизабет в пути единственным утешением.</p>
<p>При въезде в усадьбу они заметили на крыльце маленьких Гардинеров, привлеченных видом кареты. Когда карета подъехала, лица детей озарились восторгом, — дети выразили его даже своими фигурками, посредством всевозможных скачков и ужимок, — который явился приятным прологом встречи с домашним очагом.</p>
<p>Элизабет выпрыгнула из кареты и, перецеловав детей, ринулась в холл, где ее встретила Джейн, которая бегом спустилась из комнаты матери. У обеих глаза были полны слез. Сестры горячо обнялись, и младшая сразу спросила у старшей, получены ли какие-нибудь известия о беглецах.</p>
<p>— Еще нет, — ответила Джейн. — Но теперь, когда наш дорогой дядя приехал, я надеюсь, все будет хорошо.</p>
<p>— Папа в Лондоне?</p>
<p>— Да, он уехал во вторник, как я тебе сообщала.</p>
<p>— От него есть письма?</p>
<p>— Пока только одно. В среду он прислал несколько строк. Сообщил, что прибыл благополучно и сделал распоряжения, о которых я его просила. В конце говорилось, что, пока не появится что-нибудь заслуживающее упоминания, он писать не станет.</p>
<p>— А мама? Как она? Как вы все?</p>
<p>— Кажется, маме немного лучше. У нее ужасно расстроены нервы. Она наверху у себя и будет счастлива всех увидеть. Пока что она не выходит дальше гардеробной комнаты. А Мэри и Китти, слава богу, здоровы.</p>
<p>— Ну, а как себя чувствуешь ты? — воскликнула Элизабет. — Ты побледнела. Сколько же тебе, бедняжке, за это время пришлось пережить!</p>
<p>Джейн, однако, уверила ее, что чувствует себя вполне хорошо. Разговор сестер, продолжавшийся, пока Гардинеры были заняты детьми, был прерван приходом всего их семейства. Джейн по очереди обнялась с дядюшкой и тетушкой, встречая и благодаря их с улыбкой и со слезами на глазах.</p>
<p>Когда все собрались в гостиной, вопросы, заданные Элизабет, были, разумеется, повторены Гардинерами, и вскоре оказалось, что Джейн не может сообщить почти ничего нового. Тем не менее она продолжала питать свойственные ее сердцу радужные надежды. Она по-прежнему верила, что все кончится благополучно и что в любой день можно ждать письма от Лидии или от отца с объяснением действий беглецов и, быть может, известием об их бракосочетании.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет, в чью комнату они перешли после нескольких минут разговора в гостиной, встретила их так, как они и ожидали: слезами и жалобами на свою горькую участь, бранью по поводу мерзкого поступка Уикхема, причитаниями о собственных муках и упреками в адрес решительно всех, кроме единственной особы, которая своей неразумной терпимостью больше всего потакала легкомыслию дочери.</p>
<p>— Если бы я смогла настоять, чтобы все мы поехали в Брайтон, — сказала она, — ничего бы не случилось. О бедной Лидии некому было позаботиться. Разве Форстеры не должны были все время держать ее у себя на глазах? Они допустили, поверьте, вопиющую небрежность, если не что-нибудь худшее! Моя девочка не была бы на такое способна, если бы за ней присматривали. Мне всегда казалось, что им нельзя ее поручать. Но со мной, как обычно, не посчитались. Бедное, родное мое дитя! А теперь нас покинул мистер Беннет, и я знаю, он будет драться с Уикхемом, как только с ним встретится, и его убьют, и что тогда с нами со всеми станет? Коллинзы вышвырнут нас, прежде чем он остынет в гробу! И если ты, братец, над нами не сжалишься, я не знаю, куда мы денемся.</p>
<p>Все в один голос отвергли столь мрачные предположения, и после исчерпывающих заверений в своей привязанности к сестре и ко всему ее семейству мистер Гардинер обещал на следующий же день уехать в Лондон и помочь мистеру Беннету во всем, что он предпримет для спасения Лидии.</p>
<p>— Мы не должны предаваться бесплодному унынию, — добавил он. — И хотя следует подготовиться к худшему, пока что такой исход нельзя считать неизбежным. Еще не прошло недели с тех пор, как они сбежали из Брайтона. Через несколько дней мы о них услышим. И до тех пор, пока мы не узнаем, что он на ней не женился и не собирается жениться, не следует впадать в отчаяние. Как только я попаду в Лондон, я поеду к брату, перевезу его к себе на Грейсчёрч-стрит, и мы хорошенько обдумаем все, что можем с ним предпринять.</p>
<p>— Ах, дорогой братец, — воскликнула миссис Беннет, — это как раз то, чего бы мне хотелось больше всего. Пожалуйста, разыщите их там в городе, где бы они ни запропастились, и, если они еще не поженились, устройте так, чтобы они были женаты. И пусть они не откладывают этого из-за свадебных нарядов. Скажите Лидии, что, когда она окажется замужем, у нее будет достаточно денег, чтобы купить любое платье. А самое важное — спасите мистера Беннета от дуэли. Расскажите ему в каком я ужасном состоянии, что я буквально схожу с ума от страха и что у меня бывают судороги во всем теле и спазмы в боку, и такие жестокие головные боли и сердцебиение, от которых нет покоя ни днем, ни ночью. И передайте моей дорогой Лидии, чтобы она не отдавала шить платье, не повидавшись со мной, так как она не знает, в каком магазине его лучше заказывать. Ах, какой вы добрый! Я уверена, вы не забудете моей просьбы!</p>
<p>Мистер Гардинер обещал сделать все от него зависящее и вместе с тем посоветовал ей проявлять большую умеренность в своих надеждах и в своих опасениях.</p>
<p>Проговорив с ней таким образом до обеда, родные ее покинули, предоставив ей изливать свои чувства перед домоправительницей, которая ухаживала за миссис Беннет в отсутствие дочерей.</p>
<p>Мистер Гардинер и его жена были уверены, что у нее не было настоящего повода для подобного затворничества, однако не пытались ее отговаривать, зная, насколько ей недостает благоразумия, чтобы сдерживаться в разговоре за столом в присутствии прислуги. Поэтому они предпочитали, чтобы все заботы и тревоги высказывались ею лишь одному постороннему человеку, пользующемуся притом наибольшим доверием.</p>
<p>В столовой они вскоре увидели Мэри и Китти, которые были слишком заняты у себя в комнатах, чтобы выйти к ним раньше. Одна оторвалась от своих книг, а другая — от туалетного столика. Физиономии обеих казались, впрочем, вполне беззаботными. Обе девицы почти не изменились, если не считать того, что утрата любимой сестры, а быть может упреки, вызванные ее участием в происшествии, сделали Китти еще более раздражительной. Что касается Мэри, то она достаточно владела собой, чтобы, усевшись за столом рядом с Элизабет, почти сразу же прошептать ей с меланхолическим видом:</p>
<p>— Что за печальное известие! Как много оно вызовет толков! Но мы должны устоять перед натиском зла и окропить наши сердечные раны бальзамом сестринского участия.</p>
<p>Видя, что Элизабет не собирается ей отвечать, она добавила:</p>
<p>— Из печального случая с Лидией мы все же можем извлечь полезные уроки. Они заключаются в том, что утрата женщиной добродетели непоправима; что ее репутация тем более хрупка, чем более она безупречна; и что женщина никогда не может быть чрезмерно осторожной в своем отношении к недостойным представителям другого пола.</p>
<p>Элизабет удивленно подняла на нее глаза, но, чувствуя себя слишком подавленной, промолчала. И Мэри продолжала тешить свою душу столь же своевременными моральными прописями.</p>
<p>Под вечер две старшие мисс Беннет могли провести полчаса вдвоем. Элизабет сразу воспользовалась этой возможностью, чтобы задать Джейн множество вопросов, на которые ее сестра отвечала с большой охотой. После обоюдных сожалений по поводу ужасных последствий случившегося, которые Элизабет полагала почти неотвратимыми, а Джейн — весьма вероятными, первая продолжала:</p>
<p>— Но ты должна рассказать мне то, о чем я пока не имею ни малейшего представления. Как отнесся ко всему папа? Что рассказал полковник Форстер? Не было ли у Форстеров подозрений до того, как Лидия и Уикхем совершили побег? Ведь их повсюду должны были видеть вместе.</p>
<p>— Полковник Форстер подтвердил, что догадывался об их взаимной склонности, особенно со стороны Лидии. Но он не замечал ничего, что могло бы вызвать тревогу. Его было очень жалко, — по-моему, это необыкновенно добрый и отзывчивый человек. Он собирался побывать у нас, чтобы выразить свое огорчение, даже до того, как заподозрил, что они не поехали в Шотландию. А когда это подозрение возникло, он приехал немедленно.</p>
<p>— А Денни в самом деле уверен, что Уикхем на ней не женится? Он знал о готовившемся побеге? Полковник видел самого Денни?</p>
<p>— Да. Но при этом разговоре мистер Денни отрицал, что ему было заранее известно о побеге, и не сказал, что он об этом думает сам. Он больше не утверждал, что они не собираются пожениться, и это позволяет надеяться, что его перед тем неправильно поняли.</p>
<p>— А до приезда полковника вам даже не приходило в голову, что они не поженятся?</p>
<p>— Разве мы могли об этом подумать? Сама я немного тревожилась — будет ли Лидия счастлива с Уикхемом. Я же знала, что его поведение не всегда было безукоризненным. А папа и мама ничего не подозревали и понимали только, насколько этот брак неблагоразумен. И вдруг Китти, которая, естественно, гордилась своей осведомленностью, призналась, что в последнем письме Лидия предупредила ее о своем намерении. Оказывается, ей было известно, что они уже несколько недель любят друг друга.</p>
<p>— Но это началось после отъезда в Брайтон?</p>
<p>— Думаю, что да.</p>
<p>— А полковник Форстер, по-твоему, очень плохого мнения об Уикхеме? Понял он, что тот собой представляет?</p>
<p>— Признаюсь, он отзывался об Уикхеме не так лестно, как прежде. Он считает его невоздержанным и расточительным. А после печального происшествия стали говорить, что Уикхем наделал в Меритоне много долгов. Надеюсь, это окажется неправдой.</p>
<p>— Джейн, милая, если бы мы меньше скрывали, если бы мы рассказали то, что нам было о нем известно, ничего бы не случилось.</p>
<p>— Может быть, это было бы лучше, — ответила Джейн. — Но разоблачать прежние ошибки человека, не зная о его чувствах в настоящее время, кажется мне несправедливым. У нас были добрые намерения.</p>
<p>— А что рассказал полковник Форстер о содержании письма Лидии к его жене?</p>
<p>— Он захватил его с собой, чтобы показать нам. Джейн вынула письмо из памятной книжки и протянула его Элизабет. Вот что в нем говорилось:</p>
<p>«Моя дорогая Харриет, ты будешь хохотать до упаду, когда узнаешь, куда я уехала, и я сама помираю со смеху, воображая, как ты утром удивишься, когда тебе скажут, что я пропала. Я еду в Гретна-Грин, и если бы ты не догадалась, с кем именно, я считала бы тебя просто дурочкой, так как на свете существует только один человек, которого я люблю, и этот человек — ангел. Я никогда не была бы без него счастлива, так что не печалься о моем бегстве. Ты можешь не сообщать в Лонгборн о моем отъезде, если тебе это неприятно. Ведь тогда они еще больше удивятся, получив от меня письмо с подписью „Лидия Уикхем“. Вот будет потеха! Мне так смешно, что я еле вывожу буквы. Пожалуйста, принеси мои извинения Пратту за то, что я не выполнила обещания танцевать с ним сегодня вечером. Скажи ему, что он безусловно меня простит, когда обо всем узнает, и обещай, что я с большим удовольствием буду танцевать с ним на первом же балу, на котором мы встретимся. За платьями я пришлю, как только попаду в Лонгборн. Но я бы хотела, чтобы Салли зашила шов, который распоролся на моем вышитом муслиновом платье, прежде чем его запакуют.</p>
<p>Прощай. Привет полковнику Форстеру. Надеюсь, вы выпьете за наше счастливое путешествие.</p>
<p><em>Преданная тебе подруга</em></p>
<p><em>Лидия Беннет».</em></p>
<p>— Беспечная, беспечная Лидия! — воскликнула Элизабет, дочитав до конца. — И этим письмом она сообщает о таком событии в своей жизни?! Но из него, по крайней мере, следует, что сама она относилась к цели поездки серьезно. К чему бы он ни склонил ее позже, она не думала о бесчестье. Бедный отец! Как тяжело ему было это пережить!</p>
<p>— Я никогда не видела, чтобы кто-нибудь был так потрясен. В течение десяти минут он не мог произнести ни слова. А маме сразу стало плохо, и все в доме пошло вверх дном.</p>
<p>— Джейн, милая, — спросила Элизабет, — осталась ли в доме хоть одна служанка, которая не узнала бы в тот же день всех подробностей этой скандальной истории?</p>
<p>— Как тебе сказать? Надеюсь, что да. Но в ту минуту очень трудно было владеть собой. Мама была в истерике, и, хотя я всячески ей старалась помочь, боюсь, я не сделала всего, что могла. Я была в таком ужасе, думая, чем это кончится, что стала совершенно беспомощной.</p>
<p>— Ты сделала больше, чем могла. У тебя нездоровый вид. Если бы я была здесь, мне пришлось бы заботиться о тебе.</p>
<p>— Мэри и Китти были очень добры. И я уверена, они разделили бы со мной все заботы. Но я считала, что это может им повредить. Китти такая хрупкая и так легко возбуждается, а Мэри настолько погружена в свои занятия, что было бы грешно лишить их отдыха. Во вторник, после папиного отъезда, в Лонгборн приезжала тетушка Филипс. Она была так добра, что пробыла со мной до четверга и очень нам всем помогла. Леди Лукас тоже была очень великодушна. В среду она приходила выразить свое сочувствие и сказала, что она и ее дочери готовы оказать нам всяческую поддержку.</p>
<p>— Лучше бы она сидела у себя дома! — воскликнула Элизабет. — Быть может, у нее были добрейшие намерения. Но при такой беде, как наша, чем меньше видишь соседей, тем лучше. Помощь здесь невозможна, а сочувствие — непереносимо. Пускай же они радуются нашим несчастьям подальше от нас.</p>
<p>Она спросила сестру, что отец собирался предпринять для розыска.</p>
<p>— Мне кажется, — ответила Джейн, — он хотел отправиться в Эпсом — место, где они последний раз меняли лошадей, попробовать выяснить что-нибудь у кучеров. Главная его цель — узнать номер извозчика, который вез их из Клэпхема. Этот извозчик приехал с кем-то из Лондона. Папа считал, что такой случай, при котором дама и господин пересаживаются из одного экипажа в другой, не мог остаться незамеченным, и он собирался навести справки в Клэпхеме. Если ему посчастливится узнать, у какого дома извозчик перед тем высадил своих седоков, он хотел зайти в этот дом. Там ему, быть может, удастся узнать номер и место стоянки извозчика. Не знаю, что он еще собирался сделать. Он так торопился уехать и был так сильно расстроен, что я с трудом смогла добиться у него даже этого.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА VI</p>
</div>
<p>Все были уверены, что на следующее утро будет получено письмо от мистера Беннета, однако почта пришла и не принесла от него ни строчки. Члены его семьи хорошо знали, насколько он при обычных обстоятельствах небрежен в своей переписке, но рассчитывали, что сейчас он все же сделает над собой усилие. Приходилось думать, что он не может сообщить ничего хорошего, но даже об этом они рады были бы знать наверняка. Мистер Гардинер, который немного задержался в ожидании письма, уехал сразу же по прибытии почты.</p>
<p>С его отъездом они могли хотя бы надеяться, что их будут держать в курсе происходящих событий. Прощаясь, мистер Гардинер обещал как можно скорее уговорить мистера Беннета вернуться в Лонгборн. Тем самым он успокоил свою сестру, которая видела в этом для мужа единственное спасение от гибели на дуэли.</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер, считая, что племянницам может оказаться полезным ее присутствие, решила провести с детьми в Хартфордшире еще несколько дней. Она помогала им в уходе за миссис Беннет, и им было очень приятно побыть с ней в часы досуга. Другая тетка также проводила у них немало времени, желая, по ее словам, их развеселить и ободрить. Но так как у нее всегда были припасены свежие новости о расточительности и непорядочности Уикхема, она редко оставляла их менее удрученными, чем они чувствовали себя перед ее приходом.</p>
<p>Весь Меритон старался теперь всячески очернить человека, который еще три месяца тому назад казался ему чуть ли не ангелом. Стало известно, что он задолжал решительно во всех лавках. Объявленный бесчестным соблазнителем, он стал притчей во языцех по всей округе. Все считали его самым испорченным человеком на свете и наперебой клялись, что никогда не были введены в заблуждение его внешней привлекательностью. И хотя Элизабет не верила и половине всех этих толков, они доказывали, насколько справедливой была тревога за доброе имя ее сестры. Даже Джейн, которая доверяла слухам еще меньше, почти потеряла надежду на благоприятный исход дела, тем более что, если бы, как ей хотелось верить, они все же бежали в Шотландию, от беглецов уже должны были прийти какие-то вести.</p>
<p>Мистер Гардинер покинул Лонгборн в воскресенье. Во вторник его жена получила от него письмо, в котором говорилось, что он отыскал брата сразу же по прибытии и уговорил его переехать на Грейсчёрч-стрит. До его приезда мистер Беннет побывал в Эпсоме и Клэпхеме, однако ему не удалось там узнать ничего существенного. Теперь он решил справиться во всех крупных гостиницах города, считая вполне вероятным, что, прибыв в Лондон, беглецы не сразу поселились на частной квартире. Сам мистер Гардинер не рассчитывал на успех этих поисков, но, так как его брат был ими всецело поглощен, он по мере сил старался ему помогать. Далее он сообщал, что мистер Беннет в настоящее время совершенно не склонен покинуть Лондон, и обещал вскоре написать снова. В конце находился следующий постскриптум:</p>
<p>«Я попросил полковника Форстера, чтобы он, по возможности, выяснил у друзей молодого человека в полку, есть ли у Уикхема родственники или знакомые, которые могли бы знать, в какой части Лондона он скрывается. Если кого-нибудь удастся найти, это даст в наши руки важную нить для дальнейших поисков. Пока у нас нет ничего, чем бы мы могли руководствоваться. Полковник Форстер, я уверен, сделает все от него зависящее, чтобы выполнить нашу просьбу. Но позднее мне пришла в голову мысль, что Лиззи, быть может, лучше, чем кто-либо другой, знает имена его родственников, у которых он мог бы остановиться».</p>
<p>Элизабет легко поняла, как могло возникнуть подобное предположение. Однако она не располагала сведениями в этом роде и считала комплимент незаслуженным. Ей не приходилось слышать ни о каких родственниках Уикхема, кроме его отца и матери, которые скончались много лет тому назад. Можно было, однако, допустить, что кто-нибудь из его приятелей по ***ширскому полку знает больше. И хотя она верила в это мало, обращение к полковнику Форстеру позволяло на что-то надеяться.</p>
<p>Все дни были теперь наполнены различными тревогами. Но самыми беспокойными были минуты ожидания почты. Прибытие писем стало важнейшим событием каждого дня. Только из них можно было узнать о хорошем или плохом повороте событий. И каждый новый день мог принести наконец важные вести.</p>
<p>Однако прежде чем до них опять дошли известия от мистера Гардинера, было получено послание совсем иного рода, адресованное мистеру Беннету. Оно было написано мистером Коллинзом. Мистер Беннет оставил распоряжение вскрывать всю приходящую на его имя корреспонденцию, и письмо было прочитано Джейн. Вместе с ней письмо кузена прочла и Элизабет, которой были хорошо знакомы особенности его стиля. В письме говорилось:</p>
<p>«Дорогой сэр, принимая во внимание наше с Вами родство и занимаемое мною положение в обществе, я счел своим долгом выразить свое соболезнование по поводу печального события, о котором мы узнали только вчера, получив письмо из Хартфордшира. Поверьте, дорогой сэр, мы с миссис Коллинз вполне искренне сочувствуем Вам и всей Вашей высокочтимой семье в постигшем Вас горе, которое должно быть особенно глубоким, поскольку его причину невозможно исцелить временем. Со своей стороны, я не пожалею доводов, которые могли бы как-то смягчить для Вас столь серьезное несчастье или принести утешение при подобных, тягостных для Вашего родительского сердца обстоятельствах. Кончина Вашей дочери могла бы в сравнении с ними казаться благом. И — тем печальнее — скорбь о случившемся еще усугубляется в данном случае из-за того, что, как я узнал от моей дорогой Шарлотты, безнравственность Вашей дочери в какой-то мере объясняется излишней терпимостью, допущенной при ее воспитании. К утешению ее родителей, я все же склонен предполагать в ней природные дурные наклонности, без которых она не могла бы совершить столь тяжкого проступка в столь юные годы. Однако, как бы там ни было, Вы заслуживаете глубочайшего участия. Кроме миссис Коллинз, его разделяют со мной также леди Кэтрин и мисс де Бёр, коих я уже уведомил о злосчастном событии. И они присоединяются к моему опасению, что ложный шаг одной из Ваших дочерей может нанести непоправимый ущерб благополучию ее сестер. Ибо, как соизволила выразиться леди Кэтрин, едва ли кто-нибудь захочет теперь породниться с Вашей семьей. Это соображение побуждает меня с особым удовольствием вспомнить о некотором происшествии в ноябре прошлого года. Если бы дело тогда приняло иной оборот, я должен был бы сейчас делить наравне с Вами все Ваше горе и весь позор. Позвольте же, дорогой сэр, пожелать Вам утешения в той мере, в какой это возможно, и посоветовать навеки отторгнуть от себя недостойную дочь, предоставив ей самой пожинать плоды своего порочного поведения.</p>
<p><em>Остаюсь, дорогой сэр, и т.д. и т.д.».</em></p>
<p>Мистер Гардинер не писал ничего, пока не получил ответа от полковника Форстера. Ответ этот оказался неблагоприятным. Стало известно, что у Уикхема нет ни одного родственника, с которым он поддерживал бы общение, и что у него вообще не осталось близкой родни. В прежние времена он имел довольно много знакомых, однако после вступления в полк он, по-видимому, не сохранил с ними дружеских связей. Поэтому нельзя было назвать ни одного человека, который мог бы рассказать об Уикхеме что-нибудь новое. Кроме того, что он прятался от родных Лидии, он, как оказалось, должен был скрываться еще и по другой причине. Огромные карточные долги вконец расстроили его денежные дела. По мнению полковника Форстера, для покрытия его долгов в Брайтоне потребовалось бы более тысячи фунтов. Заметную часть этой суммы он задолжал торговцам в городке, однако долги чести составляли львиную долю. Мистер Гардинер не пытался скрыть эти подробности от своих родственников в Лонгборне. С ужасом выслушав это сообщение, Джейн воскликнула:</p>
<p>— Картежник! Вот уж совсем не ожидала. Мне даже в голову это не приходило!</p>
<p>Мистер Гардинер добавлял, что уже на следующий день, то есть в субботу, они могут ждать возвращения мистера Беннета. Расстроенный неудачей предпринятых им попыток, мистер Беннет уступил настойчивым уговорам шурина вернуться домой, поручив ему принимать необходимые меры сообразно с обстоятельствами. Когда об этом узнала миссис Беннет, она, вопреки предположениям дочерей, вовсе не выразила того удовлетворения, которого можно было ожидать, зная ее беспокойство за жизнь мужа.</p>
<p>— Как! — воскликнула она. — Бросить там бедную Лидию? Он не покинет Лондон, пока их не найдет! Кто же будет стреляться с Уикхемом и заставит его на ней жениться?</p>
<p>Миссис Гардинер хотела уже вернуться вместе с детьми к себе домой, и, так как на следующий день ждали приезда мистера Беннета, она могла теперь уехать. Поэтому она воспользовалась посланным из Лонгборна экипажем, на котором затем возвратился его хозяин.</p>
<p>Она покинула Лонгборн, так и не разрешив загадку отношений между Элизабет и ее дербиширским другом, над которой ломала голову с самого отъезда из Лэмтона. Элизабет никогда первая не называла его имени. Не было и письма, которое, как казалось миссис Гардинер, он мог послать им вдогонку. Со времени их возвращения на имя племянницы не приходило ничего, что могло быть отправлено из Пемберли.</p>
<p>Печальные семейные обстоятельства вполне оправдывали упадок духа у Элизабет, — искать каких-либо других причин для его объяснения было незачем. Между тем сама Элизабет, достаточно разобравшись к этому времени в своих чувствах, отлично понимала, что ей было бы легче перенести позор Лидии, не будь она знакома с мистером Дарси. По ее мнению, в этом случае количество бессонных ночей сократилось бы для нее по меньшей мере наполовину.</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет по возвращении в Лонгборн был полон свойственного ему философического спокойствия. Он разговаривал не больше, чем обычно, и вовсе не упоминал обстоятельства, из-за которого ездил в Лондон, так что дочери долго не решались с ним об этом заговорить. Молчание наконец нарушила Элизабет, осмелившаяся затронуть запретную тему за послеобеденным чаем. Выраженное ею сочувствие по поводу всего, что ему пришлось пережить, мистер Беннет встретил словами:</p>
<p>— Не будем об этом вспоминать. Кому же за это расплачиваться, как не мне? Все, что случилось, — дело моих рук, и я за все в ответе.</p>
<p>— Вы не должны слишком строго себя судить, — сказала Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Твой совет приходится очень кстати. Снисхождение к собственной персоне свойственно человеческой природе. Нет, Лиззи, дай мне хоть раз в жизни почувствовать всю глубину своей вины. Не бойся, это меня не сломит. Подобное чувство проходит довольно быстро.</p>
<p>— Вы думаете, они в Лондоне?</p>
<p>— Конечно. Где же еще они могли бы так хорошо спрятаться?</p>
<p>— Лидия ведь всегда мечтала попасть в Лондон! — вставила Китти.</p>
<p>— Значит, она добилась, чего хотела, — сухо ответил отец. — Возможно, ее пребывание там продлится довольно долго.</p>
<p>После короткой паузы он добавил:</p>
<p>— Лиззи, я на тебя не в обиде за сделанное тобой в мае столь оправдавшееся предостережение, ведь оно, учитывая обстоятельства, свидетельствует в пользу здравого смысла.</p>
<p>Разговор был прерван появлением Джейн, которая пришла приготовить чай для миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>— Что за великолепное представление! — воскликнул мистер Беннет. — Оно придает горю вашей матери такой благородный оттенок. С завтрашнего дня я последую ее примеру: засяду в ночном колпаке и халате в библиотеке и постараюсь причинять вам как можно больше хлопот. Или, быть может, мне подождать, пока от нас сбежит Китти?</p>
<p>— Я никуда не собираюсь сбегать, — ответила Китти с раздражением. — Если я когда-нибудь попаду в Брайтон, ничего подобного со мной не случится.</p>
<p>— Ты попадешь в Брайтон? Я и за пятьдесят фунтов не отпущу тебя даже до Ист-Бёрна. Нет, Китти, наконец-то я научился осторожности. И тебе это придется почувствовать. Ни один офицер больше не переступит порога моего дома — и носа не сунет в нашу деревню. И никаких больше танцев — если только тебе не вздумается танцевать с одной из сестер. Я не позволю тебе выходить из дома, пока ты не докажешь, что способна заниматься чем-то разумным хоть десять минут в течение суток.</p>
<p>Китти, принявшая эти слова всерьез, горько расплакалась.</p>
<p>— Ну, так и быть, — сказал мистер Беннет, — можешь не огорчаться. Если на протяжении десяти лет ты будешь паинькой, к концу срока я непременно свожу тебя на какое-нибудь обозрение<a href="#ref5" class="a" onclick="save();">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА VII</p>
</div>
<p>Спустя два дня после возвращения мистера Беннета, когда Джейн и Элизабет гуляли позади дома среди зарослей кустарника, они увидели приближавшуюся к ним домоправительницу. Подумав, что она идет за ними, чтобы позвать их к миссис Беннет, они пошли ей навстречу. Но вместо того чтобы передать какое-нибудь поручение матери, она сказала, обращаясь к Джейн:</p>
<p>— Прошу прощения, сударыня, что помешала вашему разговору. Я подумала, что из Лондона пришли, быть может, добрые вести, и мне захотелось узнать, в чем они заключаются.</p>
<p>— Что вы имеете в виду, Хилл? Из Лондона не было никаких писем.</p>
<p>— Как, сударыня, — с большим удивлением воскликнула миссис Хилл, — вы не знаете, что к хозяину прибыл нарочный от мистера Гардинера? Прошло не менее получаса с тех пор, как он передал пакет мистеру Беннету.</p>
<p>Желая поскорее узнать о новостях, сестры без лишних слов бросились к дому. Пробежав холл, они заглянули сперва в комнату для завтрака, потом в библиотеку и, не найдя отца там, были уже готовы искать его наверху, в комнате матери, когда встретившийся им дворецкий сказал:</p>
<p>— Если вы, сударыни, ищете хозяина, то попробуйте догнать его около рощи — он только что пошел в том направлении.</p>
<p>Пользуясь этим указанием, они снова миновали холл и побежали прямо через газон догонять отца, который решительным шагом направлялся к группе деревьев на краю усадьбы.</p>
<p>Более полная и менее привыкшая к бегу старшая сестра вскоре отстала, тогда как запыхавшаяся младшая, догнав отца, с нетерпением забросала его вопросами:</p>
<p>— Ах, папа, что там такое? Есть новости? Что-нибудь от дяди Гардинера?</p>
<p>— Да, он прислал письмо с нарочным.</p>
<p>— Что же он пишет? Хорошее или плохое?</p>
<p>— Разве мы можем ожидать хороших вестей? — сказал отец, вынимая из кармана письмо. — Впрочем, тебе, быть может, интересно его прочесть.</p>
<p>Элизабет нетерпеливо выхватила письмо, как раз в ту минуту, когда их догнала Джейн.</p>
<p>— Прочти-ка вслух, — попросил мистер Беннет, — я сам едва ли в нем разобрался как следует.</p>
<p><em>«Грейсчёрч-стрит, понедельник, 2 августа.</em></p>
<p>Дорогой брат, наконец-то могу сообщить некоторые сведения о моей племяннице, которые, я надеюсь, должны Вас несколько успокоить. Вскоре после Вашего отъезда в субботу мне удалось выяснить, в какой части Лондона они скрываются. О подробностях расскажу Вам при встрече. Достаточно знать, что они обнаружены и что я видел обоих…»</p>
<p>— Ну вот, теперь мы убедились, что все вышло, как я и предполагала, — перебила Джейн, — они поженились!</p>
<p>Элизабет продолжила чтение.</p>
<p>— «Я видел обоих. Они не поженились, и никаких приготовлений к свадьбе я не заметил. Однако, если Вы согласитесь с предложениями, которые я осмелился сделать от Вашего имени, я надеюсь, что свадьба произойдет достаточно быстро. Все, что от Вас требуется, — это письменно подтвердить ее пятую долю в пяти тысячах фунтов, остающихся Вашим детям после смерти родителей, а также ежегодную выплату ей ста фунтов, пока Вы живы. После всего, что случилось, я без колебаний согласился с этими условиями, пользуясь привилегией быть Вашим доверенным лицом. Это письмо я посылаю с нарочным, так как Ваш ответ должен быть получен как можно скорее. Вышесказанное позволит Вам понять, что положение мистера Уикхема вовсе не столь безнадежно, как представляется многим. В этом смысле все были введены в заблуждение, и я счастлив сообщить, что даже после выплаты всех долгов у него сохранится небольшая сумма, которую он сможет отложить на имя моей племянницы в добавление к ее собственным средствам. Если, как я рассчитываю, Вы подтвердите мои полномочия действовать от Вашего имени во всем этом деле, я незамедлительно поручу Хагерстону подготовить соответствующий контракт. Вам совершенно не нужно снова приезжать в Лондон, поэтому спокойно оставайтесь в Лонгборне, полагаясь на мои старания и заботы. Пришлите ответ как можно скорее и будьте добры выразиться достаточно определенно. Мы здесь решили — и я рассчитываю на Ваше одобрение, — что племянница должна отправиться в церковь из нашего дома. К нам она переберется сегодня. Я напишу Вам еще раз, как только будут уточнены некоторые подробности.</p>
<p><em>Ваш и т.д.</em></p>
<p><em>Эдв. Гардинер».</em></p>
<p>— Может ли это быть? — сложив письмо, проговорила Элизабет. — Неужели он на ней женится?</p>
<p>— Значит, Уикхем вовсе не такой негодяй, каким мы себе его представляли! — воскликнула Джейн. — Папа, милый, поздравляю Вас!</p>
<p>— Вы уже ответили на письмо? — спросила Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Еще нет. Но это следует сделать поскорее.</p>
<p>Элизабет принялась горячо уговаривать отца не откладывать дела ни на минуту.</p>
<p>— Папа, пожалуйста, — взмолилась она, — возвращайтесь и напишите дяде тотчас же. Вы только подумайте, как опасно при таких обстоятельствах малейшее промедление!</p>
<p>— Может быть, мне написать письмо от вашего имени, — предложила Джейн, — если вам неприятно сделать это самому?</p>
<p>— Разумеется, неприятно, — ответил он. — Но, увы, письмо должно быть написано.</p>
<p>С этими словами они зашагали обратно к дому.</p>
<p>— Я бы хотела спросить об одном, — сказала Элизабет. — Вы примете предложенные условия?</p>
<p>— Приму ли я условия? Да мне просто стыдно за него оттого, что он так мало потребовал.</p>
<p>— И она должна стать его женой! Даже при том, что он <em>такой</em> человек!</p>
<p>— Да, да, стать его женой. Теперь уже ничего не поделаешь. Но мне бы хотелось понять две вещи. Во-первых, сколько денег ему посулил ваш дядюшка, а во-вторых, каким образом я смогу эти деньги ему вернуть?</p>
<p>— Деньги? — воскликнула Джейн. — Дядюшке? Что вы имеете в виду?</p>
<p>— А то, что ни один человек в здравом уме не женился бы на Лидии ради какой-то сотни фунтов в год при моей жизни и пятидесяти, когда я умру.</p>
<p>— В самом деле, — сказала Элизабет, — это не приходило мне раньше в голову. Будут выплачены долги, да еще что-то останется! Без дядюшки тут, конечно, не обошлось. Какой он у нас добрый и щедрый! Но как бы это его не разорило! Небольшая сумма тут бы не помогла.</p>
<p>— Никоим образом, — согласился отец. — Уикхем был бы дураком, женись он на ней меньше чем за десять тысяч. Мне бы не хотелось думать о нем так плохо сразу после того, как мы с ним породнимся.</p>
<p>— Десять тысяч? Силы небесные! Но разве мы могли бы вернуть даже половину такой суммы?</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет ничего не ответил, и каждый из них, погруженный в собственные думы, не сказал ни слова, пока они не подошли к дому. Отец прошел прямо в библиотеку, чтобы написать письмо, а дочери направились в комнату для завтрака.</p>
<p>— Неужели они в самом деле поженятся? — воскликнула Элизабет. — Просто не верится! И <em>этому</em> мы еще должны радоваться! Поженятся без малейшей надежды на семейное счастье и несмотря на все пороки ее будущего мужа, — вот в чем теперь ее спасенье! Ах, Лидия, Лидия!</p>
<p>— Я утешаю себя мыслью, — сказала Джейн, — что он не женился бы на Лидии, если бы не питал к ней настоящего чувства. И хотя наш добрый дядя чем-то ему помог, мне не верится, что речь могла идти о десяти тысячах или даже о чем-то к этому близком. У Гардинеров есть дети и, может быть, будут еще. Разве дядя вправе отнимать у них даже половину подобной суммы?</p>
<p>— Если бы мы знали его долги, — сказала Элизабет, — да еще выяснили, сколько денег, согласно брачному контракту, он отложит на имя сестры, мы могли бы точно определить, что ему посулил дядя. У самого Уикхема нет за душой и шестипенсовика. Нам никогда не удастся расплатиться с дядей и тетей. То, что они решились принять Лидию под свой кров, окружить ее заботой и защитить своим добрым именем, является с их стороны такой жертвой, которая заслуживает многих лет благодарности. Сейчас она уже должна быть у них! Если даже такое их великодушие по-настоящему ее не растрогает, она вообще не заслуживает счастья. Как она смогла посмотреть тетушке в глаза!</p>
<p>— Надо постараться не вспоминать обо всем, что натворили Уикхем и Лидия, — сказала Джейн. — Так хочется поверить в их будущее благополучие! Его согласие на брак с ней — залог того, что он начинает исправляться. Взаимная привязанность сделает их менее легкомысленными, и они, я надеюсь, заживут разумно и счастливо, а их прежнее поведение мало-помалу будет забыто.</p>
<p>— Их поведение было таким, — ответила Элизабет, — что ни мне, ни тебе и никому другому о нем не забыть. Об этом и говорить нечего.</p>
<p>Здесь обе они вспомнили, что их мать едва ли что-нибудь знает о полученном письме, и зашли в библиотеку спросить у отца, не хочет ли он, чтобы она о нем узнала. Отец еще продолжал писать. Не поднимая головы, он равнодушно ответил:</p>
<p>— Это ваше дело.</p>
<p>— А можно взять письмо, чтобы прочесть его маме?</p>
<p>— Берите что хотите и оставьте меня в покое.</p>
<p>Элизабет схватила письмо с письменного стола, и они побежали наверх. У миссис Беннет оказались в это время Мэри и Китти, поэтому достаточно было одного сообщения. После нескольких слов о приходе хороших вестей письмо было прочтено вслух. Миссис Беннет едва смогла совладать со своими чувствами. Как только Джейн дошла до надежд мистера Гардинера на предстоящую свадьбу, на ее лице выразился необыкновенный восторг, и каждая следующая фраза увеличивала ее ликование. Теперь она пришла в такое же возбуждение от счастья, в каком пребывала прежде из-за тревог и огорчений. Ей было достаточно знать, что ее дочь выходит замуж. Забота о благополучии дочери, так же, как сожаление о ее легкомысленном поступке, совершенно не приходили ей в голову.</p>
<p>— Лидия, девочка моя! — восклицала миссис Беннет. — Как это чудесно! Она будет замужем! Я скоро ее увижу! Выйдет замуж в шестнадцать лет! Добрый, хороший братец! Я была убеждена, что так кончится, — он должен был все устроить! Если бы вы знали, как мне хочется ее видеть! И душеньку Уикхема тоже! Но как же быть с туалетами? Что же делать со свадебным платьем? Надо сейчас же написать сестре Гардинер. Лиззи, голубушка, сбегай вниз к папе и разузнай у него, сколько он на это может дать денег. Ах, нет, постой! Я лучше схожу к нему сама. Китти, позвони, чтобы пришла Хилл. Я сию же минуту оденусь. Лидия, милочка моя! Вот будет праздник, когда она к нам приедет!</p>
<p>Старшая дочь попыталась было остановить ее восторженные излияния, напомнив матери, сколь многим они обязаны мистеру Гардинеру.</p>
<p>— Все кончилось хорошо, — добавила она, — только благодаря его доброте. По-видимому, он помог мистеру Уикхему значительной суммой.</p>
<p>— Ну что ж, это вполне естественно! — ответила миссис Беннет. — Кому же и позаботиться о ней, как не родному дяде? Если бы у него не было семьи, его деньги достались бы мне и девочкам. Не считая подарков, мы от него впервые что-то получим. Но я так рада, так рада! Еще немного — и у меня будет замужняя дочь!.. Миссис Уикхем! Как это прекрасно звучит. А ведь всего только в июне ей исполнилось шестнадцать! Джейн, голубушка, я так разволновалась, что, наверно, не смогу ничего написать. О деньгах мы поговорим с папой позже. Но платье нужно заказать сию же минуту.</p>
<p>И она начала подробно обсуждать достоинства муслина, кисеи и батиста и хотела уже отправить обширный заказ, когда Джейн с некоторым трудом объяснила ей необходимость повременить с этим до того, как будет получено согласие мистера Беннета. Один день задержки, как объяснила Джейн, не имел большого значения, и благодаря превосходному расположению духа миссис Беннет оказалась на этот раз более сговорчивой, чем обычно. В ее голове возникали все новые планы.</p>
<p>— Как только я оденусь, — заявила она, — я тут же поеду в Меритон, чтобы сообщить о наших новостях сестре Филипс. А на обратном пути можно будет навестить еще Лукасов и миссис Лонг. Китти, беги вниз и прикажи заложить карету. Воздух, я уверена, будет мне очень полезен. Девочки, что вы хотите, чтобы я для вас сделала в Меритоне? А вот наконец и Хилл. Хилл, дорогая, вы слышали, какие у нас чудесные новости? Мисс Лидия выходит замуж! И вам всем подадут чашу с пуншем, чтобы вы как следует повеселились по случаю ее свадьбы.</p>
<p>Миссис Хилл, разумеется, пришла в восторг, и Элизабет вместе с другими выслушала ее поздравления. После этого, утомленная суетой, она ушла к себе в комнату, чтобы обо всем спокойно подумать.</p>
<p>Положение Лидии было достаточно плачевным. Однако следовало радоваться, что она не попала в худшую беду. И Элизабет этому радовалась. Заглядывая в будущее, нельзя было ждать для Лидии ни семейного счастья, ни обеспеченности. Но, вспоминая, чего только два часа назад все они так боялись, Элизабет не могла не оценить преимуществ такого исхода дела.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id53"></span></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА VIII</p>
</div>
<p>Мистер Беннет уже давно собирался начать что-то откладывать от своих доходов. При этом он мог бы постепенно скопить некоторую сумму и обеспечить будущее своих дочерей, а также и жены на случай, если бы ей довелось его пережить. И сейчас он с особой остротой почувствовал, насколько разумной была бы такая экономия. Если бы прежде он подобным образом исполнил свой долг, Лидия не была бы теперь обязана своему дяде выкупом доброго имени и чести. И тогда приобретение в качестве супруга самого дрянного молодого человека во всем королевстве было бы обставлено вполне подобающим образом.</p>
<p>То, что такое сомнительное счастье будет целиком оплачено из средств шурина, серьезно огорчало мистера Беннета, поэтому он решил выяснить израсходованную сумму и при первой же возможности вернуть долг. Когда мистер Беннет женился, он предполагал, что можно не стремиться к экономии, так как подразумевалось, что у супругов должен родиться наследник. Став совершеннолетним, сын закрепил бы имение за семьей, обеспечив будущее вдовы и младших детей. Но, одна за другой, на свет появились пять дочерей, а сына все не было. Миссис Беннет сохраняла уверенность в предстоящем рождении наследника еще в течение многих лет после того, как родилась Лидия. В конце концов от надежд пришлось отказаться, однако копить деньги было уже поздно. Миссис Беннет не была бережлива по натуре, и только нежелание ее мужа влезать в долги не позволяло им расходовать средств больше, чем они получали от своего имения.</p>
<p>Свадебным контрактом за миссис Беннет и ее потомством было закреплено пять тысяч фунтов. Распределение денег между детьми зависело от решения родителей. Такое решение предстояло сейчас принять, по крайней мере, относительно Лидии. И у мистера Беннета не возникало колебаний по поводу условий, предложенных мистером Гардинером. Выразив самым любезным, хотя и кратким, образом свою признательность шурину за его доброту, он далее одобрил предпринятые мистером Гардинером шаги, а также подтвердил свое согласие выполнить взятые от его имени обязательства. Раньше ему не пришло бы в голову, что он может выдать дочь за Уикхема — даже если бы сам Уикхем захотел на ней жениться — при столь незначительных затратах. Учитывая стоимость содержания Лидии, ее карманные расходы и частые денежные подарки, которые дочка получала от матери, при ежегодной выплате супругам ста фунтов он терял в год не больше десяти.</p>
<p>То, что все это потребовало так мало усилий с его стороны, было не менее приятным сюрпризом. Сейчас он хотел бы, по возможности, избавиться от дальнейших хлопот. После первого порыва негодования, побудившего его пуститься на розыски дочери, он, естественно, вернулся к своей прежней невозмутимости. Письмо было написано весьма быстро, — мистер Беннет долго раздумывал, прежде чем что-нибудь предпринять, но, взявшись за дело, сразу же доводил его до конца. В заключительной части письма выражалось желание узнать, чем он еще обязан своему шурину. На Лидию он сердился так сильно, что от всякого обращения к дочери решил воздержаться.</p>
<p>Хорошие вести тотчас же разнеслись по дому и с невероятной быстротой распространились по всей округе. Конечно, толки о мисс Лидии приобрели бы значительно больший интерес, если бы ее воротили в Меритон или, еще того лучше, сослали на какую-нибудь отдаленную ферму. Однако по поводу ее замужества тоже можно было всласть посудачить. И пожелания счастья, не сходившие с уст злорадных кумушек городка, почти не утратили с переменой обстоятельств своей выразительности, так как брак с человеком, подобным Уикхему, говоря по совести, никак не мог оказаться счастливым.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет в течение двух недель ни разу не выходила в столовую. Но этот счастливый день ознаменовался тем, что она наконец в наилучшем расположении духа возглавила стол. Стыд за Лидию ни малейшим образом не омрачил ее торжества. Мечта о свадьбе какой-нибудь из дочерей, ставшая ее навязчивой идеей с тех пор, как Джейн минуло шестнадцать лет, близилась к осуществлению. Ее мысли и разговоры вертелись только вокруг принадлежностей для свадебной церемонии, образчиков тонкого муслина, новых экипажей и новой прислуги. С необыкновенной энергией она принялась подыскивать какой-нибудь близко расположенный дом, который ее дочь могла бы занять после свадьбы. И, ничего не зная и даже не задумываясь о средствах, которыми будет располагать молодая пара, она отвергла немало домов, считая их неподходящими по своему расположению или размерам.</p>
<p>— Мог бы подойти, пожалуй, Хэй-парк, — рассуждала она, — вздумай Голдинги из него выехать. Или большой дом в Стоуке, если бы только гостиная в нем была чуть-чуть побольше. Что же касается Эшуорта, то до него слишком далеко — я не перенесу, если нас будет разделять целых десять миль. А в Палвис Лодже совершенно невозможный верхний этаж!</p>
<p>Ее муж не мешал ей болтать подобным образом, пока в комнате находилась прислуга. Однако как только посторонние удалились, он обратился к ней со словами:</p>
<p>— Прежде чем вы, миссис Беннет, арендуете для вашей дочери и ее мужа одно из этих прекрасных имений или даже сразу все вместе, я бы хотел, чтобы между нами существовала ясная договоренность вот по какому вопросу. В один дом в нашей местности они никогда не будут допущены. Я отнюдь не собираюсь поощрять их легкомыслие, принимая их у себя в Лонгборне.</p>
<p>Это заявление вызвало бурю протестов, но мистер Беннет оставался непоколебимым. И через некоторое время миссис Беннет в пылу спора обнаружила, к своему изумлению и ужасу, что ее супруг не собирается потратить ни одной гинеи на покупку свадебных туалетов. Он заявил, что Лидии не следует рассчитывать ни на какие знаки внимания с его стороны. Миссис Беннет это казалось непостижимым. Подобная необузданность родительского гнева, из-за которой их дочь должна была потерять все, ради чего, собственно говоря, стоило выходить замуж, превосходила границы ее разумения. Недостаток свадебных туалетов казался ей гораздо более позорным обстоятельством, нежели бегство Лидии и ее совместная жизнь с Уикхемом в течение двух недель, перед свадьбой.</p>
<p>Элизабет теперь горько раскаивалась, что в расстройстве чувств высказала мистеру Дарси свои опасения за судьбу Лидии. Поскольку ее бегство в скором времени должно было благополучно завершиться замужеством, можно было надеяться скрыть это происшествие от всех, кто не присутствовал тогда в Брайтоне.</p>
<p>Она не боялась, что он расскажет об этой истории посторонним. Едва ли она знала другого человека, чья сдержанность заслуживала бы большего доверия. Но ей было особенно больно, что именно ему стало известно об их семейном позоре. Дело было не в том, что от этого страдали какие-то ее собственные интересы. При всех обстоятельствах между ними лежала теперь непреодолимая пропасть. Даже если бы Лидия вышла замуж, как подобает порядочной девушке, нельзя было предположить, чтобы мистер Дарси породнился с семьей, ко всем недостаткам которой добавлялась еще родственная близость с человеком, столь заслуживающим его презрения. Мысль о подобном родстве должна была, разумеется, привести его в ужас. Стремление мистера Дарси заслужить ее благосклонность, столь бросавшееся в глаза в Дербишире, не могло, по здравом размышлении, устоять перед подобным ударом. Она была подавлена, удручена, переживала утрату сама не зная чего. Его привязанность к ней стала ей вдруг особенно дорога — как раз тогда, когда уже нельзя было рассчитывать, что она сохранится. Элизабет хотелось знать о его жизни, хотя теперь трудно было предположить, что до нее будут доходить о нем какие-то сведения. И уверенность в том, что она могла бы прожить рука об руку с Дарси счастливую жизнь, пришла к ней тогда, когда у нее не осталось почти никакой надежды еще раз с ним встретиться.</p>
<p>«Как было бы польщено самолюбие Дарси, — нередко приходило ей в голову, — если бы он узнал, что его предложение, столь гордо отвергнутое ею всего лишь четыре месяца тому назад, было бы сейчас с радостью и благодарностью принято!» Она не сомневалась в его великодушии, которым он превосходил всех представителей своего пола. Но, будучи смертным, даже он не мог бы удержаться от сознания своего торжества.</p>
<p>Лишь теперь стала она понимать, что он был как раз тем человеком, который больше всего подходил ей по своему нраву и склонностям. Свойства его ума и характера, хотя и отличные от ее собственных, отвечали всем ее требованиям. Союз между ними был бы благотворен для обоих. Легкость и жизнерадостность ее натуры придали бы больше мягкости его суждениям и манерам. А сама она стала бы более глубоким человеком благодаря его обширным знаниям, здравому смыслу и развитому уму.</p>
<p>Увы, столь счастливому браку, который показал бы восхищенному человечеству, что собой представляет истинное супружеское счастье, было не суждено состояться! Вместо этого в семействе Беннетов вскоре должен был быть заключен брак иного рода, в котором всякая возможность супружеского счастья была заранее исключена.</p>
<p>Она не могла даже представить, каким образом Уикхем и Лидия обеспечат себе сколько-нибудь приличное и независимое существование. Но зато она отлично понимала, как мало подлинного счастья ждет супружескую чету, соединившуюся под влиянием страстей, которые оказались более сильными, чем чувство ответственности и долга.</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет вскоре получил из Лондона новое письмо. Отвечая на лестный отзыв о предпринятых им шагах, мистер Гардинер писал, что он всегда готов услужить каждому члену их семьи, и просил больше никогда не касаться этого предмета. Главным поводом для письма явилась необходимость сообщить Беннетам, что мистер Уикхем решил покинуть милицию.</p>
<p>«…Я настаивал на этом с тех пор, как была достигнута договоренность об их браке, — добавлялось в письме. — И вы, наверно, со мной согласитесь, что уход из полка настолько же в его интересах, как и в интересах моей племянницы. Мистер Уикхем намерен вступить в регулярную армию. И среди его прежних друзей нашелся человек, который хочет и располагает возможностью ему в этом помочь. Ему обещают чин прапорщика в полку генерала ***, расквартированном на севере. Такая удаленность от здешних мест представляется мне большим преимуществом. Он дал слово хорошо там себя вести, и я надеюсь, что в новом окружении, по отношению к которому им придется соблюдать известную сдержанность, они проявят большее благоразумие. Я написал полковнику Форстеру, как складываются наши дела, и просил его успокоить различных кредиторов мистера Уикхема в Брайтоне и его окрестностях, сказав им, что все его долги вскоре будут погашены и что всю ответственность я беру на себя. Быть может, Вы не сочтете за труд заверить подобным же образом его кредиторов в Меритоне, список которых я составлю для Вас, основываясь на сведениях, полученных от молодого человека. Он передал нам перечень всех своих долгов. Надеюсь, по крайней мере, что он нас не обманывает. Хагерстону отданы распоряжения, и в течение недели со всеми делами будет покончено. После этого они отправятся в его полк, если только не будут приглашены в Лонгборн. По мнению миссис Гардинер, нашей племяннице очень бы хотелось Вас повидать, прежде чем она уедет на север. Она пребывает в добром здравии и просит почтительнейше напомнить о себе Вам и ее матери.</p>
<p>Ваш и т.д.</p>
<p><em>Э. Гардинер».</em></p>
<p>Мистер Беннет и его дочки не хуже, чем мистер Гардинер, понимали все преимущества того, что Уикхем покинет свой прежний полк. Но миссис Беннет обрадовалась этому гораздо меньше. Она еще не потеряла надежды, что Лидия будет жить где-нибудь в Хартфордшире. Поэтому предполагаемое переселение дочери на север, как раз в то время, когда ее постоянное присутствие могло доставить матери наибольшее удовольствие, вызвало у нее жестокое разочарование. Вдобавок мать огорчало, что Лидия будет вынуждена расстаться с полком, в котором решительно все с ней знакомы и она имеет столько поклонников.</p>
<p>— Она так обожает миссис Форстер, — говорила миссис Беннет, — что разлучить их просто грешно! И там есть еще несколько молодых людей, от которых она без ума. Офицеры в полку генерала *** могут оказаться вовсе не столь приятными кавалерами. Просьба Лидии, — если только можно было говорить о какой-то просьбе, — чтобы ей позволили повидаться с родными, прежде чем она отправится на север, <em>была</em> мистером Беннетом вначале решительно отвергнута. Однако, щадя чувства и доброе имя сестры, Джейн и Элизабет, прибегая к ласке и убеждению, принялись настойчиво уговаривать отца, чтобы Лидии с мужем было позволено после свадьбы приехать в Лонгборн. В конце концов они добились того, что мистер Беннет стал смотреть на вещи их глазами и поступил так, как им хотелось. И, к своему удовольствию, миссис Беннет узнала, что, прежде чем Уикхемы уедут в изгнание на север, она сможет показаться со своей замужней дочерью в местном обществе. Мистер Беннет написал шурину о своем согласии на их приезд. Было решено, что молодые выедут в Лонгборн сразу по окончании свадебной церемонии. Элизабет, однако, удивилась, что план этот был принят Уикхемом. И если бы она считалась только с собственными чувствами, она сделала бы все, чтобы избежать этой встречи.</p>

<p>ГЛАВА IX</p>
</div>
<p>Джейн и Элизабет пережили в день свадьбы сестры, пожалуй, больше, чем сама новобрачная. Посланный за молодыми экипаж должен был их встретить у *** и вернуться к обеду. Этой минуты обе старшие мисс Беннет ждали с огромным беспокойством. Особенно сильно волновалась Джейн, приписывавшая Лидии чувства, которые владели бы ею самой, будь она виновницей всех событий. Мысль о том, что должна была вытерпеть ее бедная сестра, приводила ее в отчаяние.</p>
<p>Наконец они прибыли. Вся семья собралась встретить их в комнате для завтрака. Когда экипаж остановился у подъезда, лицо миссис Беннет расплылось в улыбке, ее муж казался непроницаемо серьезным, а дочери трепетали от волнения и чувства неловкости.</p>
<p>Голос Лидии раздался из холла, дверь распахнулась, и она ворвалась в комнату. Мать бросилась к ней с распростертыми объятиями, приветствуя ее в полнейшем восторге. Затем она с нежной улыбкой протянула руку вошедшему следом Уикхему и так весело пожелала обоим счастья, как будто ей и в голову не приходило сомневаться в их светлом будущем.</p>
<p>Мистер Беннет, к которому они затем подошли, встретил их совсем не так сердечно. Лицо его приобрело, пожалуй, еще более суровое выражение, и он почти не раскрыл рта. Легкомысленная беспечность молодой четы в самом деле могла только еще больше его рассердить. Элизабет пришла от нее в крайнее негодование, и даже Джейн была возмущена. Лидия по-прежнему оставалась Лидией — бесцеремонной, нескромной, шумной, неугомонной и бестактной. Переходя от одной сестры к другой, она каждую заставила принести ей свои поздравления. В конце концов, когда все наконец расселись по местам, она с жадностью обвела глазами комнату, обратила внимание на некоторые новшества в обстановке и со смехом заметила, что с тех пор, как она в последний раз здесь находилась, прошло не такое уж короткое время.</p>
<p>Уикхем тоже не испытывал ни малейшего замешательства. Всегда отличавшие его приятные манеры, его улыбки и непринужденность, с которой он заявил о своих родственных правах, могли бы привлечь к нему сердца всех членов семьи, если бы только он женился, как принято, и всем собравшимся не был известен его подлинный характер. Элизабет раньше не пришло бы в голову, до чего могла дойти его самоуверенность. И, сидя в этой комнате, она дала себе зарок в будущем никогда не верить в существование предела бесстыдства для бесстыдного человека. Ее то и дело бросало в краску. Краснела и Джейн. Но у тех двоих, кто заставлял их краснеть, цвет лица совершенно не менялся.</p>
<p>Разговор завязался без малейшего затруднения. Новобрачная не могла вдоволь наговориться со своей матерью. Уикхем, которому посчастливилось сидеть рядом с Элизабет, принялся расспрашивать ее о своих прежних хартфордширских знакомых с таким беспечным видом, с каким она была не в состоянии отвечать на его вопросы. Казалось, у этой парочки не было ничего, что хоть сколько-нибудь могло омрачить их воспоминания. Ничто в прошлом не вызывало сожалений. И Лидия старалась навести разговор на те самые темы, затронуть которые ее сестры не решились бы ни за какие блага на свете.</p>
<p>— Подумать только, — воскликнула она, — ведь я уехала целых три месяца назад! А мне, честное слово, чудится, что пролетело каких-нибудь две недели. Однако за это время произошла уйма всяких событий. Боже правый, когда я уезжала отсюда, мне и в голову не могло прийти, что я вернусь сюда замужней дамой. Впрочем, мне все же казалось, что это было бы очень забавно.</p>
<p>При этих словах отец поднял на нее глаза, Джейн почувствовала себя неловко, а Элизабет бросила на Лидию выразительный взгляд. Однако та продолжала болтать с присущей ей способностью не видеть и не слышать ничего, что она предпочитала оставлять без внимания.</p>
<p>— Кстати, мама, все ли здесь знают о моем замужестве? Я ужасно боялась, что эта новость еще недостаточно широко разнеслась. Поэтому, когда мы обгоняли шарабан Уильяма Голдинга, я нарочно устроила так, чтобы ему все стало ясно. Я опустила стекло с его стороны и стянула перчатку. И положила руку на раму, чтобы он увидел на ней кольцо. А потом стала ему кланяться, улыбаться и всякое такое.</p>
<p>Элизабет была не в состоянии больше выносить эту болтовню. Вскочив с места, она выбежала из комнаты и не возвращалась, пока не услышала, что все через холл перешли в столовую. Она вошла туда как раз вовремя, чтобы увидеть, как Лидия торжественно направилась к месту за столом по правую руку от миссис Беннет и произнесла, обращаясь к старшей сестре:</p>
<p>— Ах, Джейн, мне теперь полагается занять твое место, а тебе — сесть подальше. Ведь я уже замужем.</p>
<p>Трудно было ожидать, что у Лидии со временем появится хоть капля скромности, которой она всегда была полностью лишена. Напротив, ее бесцеремонность и самодовольство возросли еще больше. Ей не терпелось повидать миссис Филипс, Лукасов и прочих соседей и услышать, как все они будут называть ее «миссис Уикхем». А пока что, сразу после обеда, она побежала похвастаться замужеством и показать обручальное кольцо двум служанкам и миссис Хилл.</p>
<p>— Ну, а как вам, маменька, нравится мой супруг? — спросила она, когда они снова собрались в комнате для завтрака. — Не правда ли, это душка? Сестрицы мне, верно, ужасно завидуют. Я была бы в восторге, если бы им хоть вполовину так повезло. Всем им надо отправиться в Брайтон. Вот место, где добывают мужей! Так жаль, маменька, что мы не смогли туда выехать всей семьей!</p>
<p>— Еще бы! Будь моя воля, мы были бы там все вместе. Но, Лидия, милочка моя, мне все же не совсем понравилось, как ты оттуда уехала. Разве это было необходимо?</p>
<p>— Боже мой, ну конечно! Что ж тут такого? В этом и заключалась вся прелесть! Надо, чтобы ты, и папа, и все сестрицы непременно нас невестили. Мы проживем в Ньюкасле всю зиму, и я не сомневаюсь, что там будут устраиваться балы. Можете на меня положиться, у всех у них будут отличные кавалеры.</p>
<p>— Мне бы этого хотелось больше всего на свете! — сказала миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>— А когда будете возвращаться, вы можете одну или двух сестер оставить у нас. Будьте спокойны, до исхода зимы я им подыщу женихов.</p>
<p>— Я очень благодарна за мою долю твоих забот, — сказала Элизабет. — Но твой способ выхода замуж мне как-то не по душе.</p>
<p>Молодожены должны были прожить с ними только десять дней. Перед отъездом из Лондона мистер Уикхем получил назначение в полк, куда ему надлежало прибыть спустя две недели. Краткостью их пребывания в Лонгборне не был опечален никто, кроме миссис Беннет. И почти все дни у мамаши и дочки уходили на визиты к соседям и весьма частые приемы гостей в собственном доме. Постоянное присутствие посторонних, позволявшее избежать встреч в семейном кругу, было одинаково удобно тем, кто о чем-то задумывался, и тем, кто ни о чем задумываться не желал.</p>
<p>Отношение Уикхема к жене оказалось именно таким, как Элизабет ожидала. Его нельзя было даже сравнить с привязанностью, которую испытывала к своему мужу Лидия. Первый же взгляд на них подтвердил предположение, что побег вызван скорее ее чувствами, нежели его. И Элизабет не могла бы объяснить, как Уикхем, не будучи сильно увлечен Лидией, вообще решился на этот шаг, если бы не знала о расстройстве в его денежных делах, из-за которого он должен был покинуть Брайтон. При таких обстоятельствах Уикхем отнюдь не был тем человеком, который мог устоять перед соблазном захватить кого-то с собой.</p>
<p>Лидия была от него без ума. Она пользовалась любым поводом, чтобы назвать его своим «дорогим Уикхемом». Он не имел себе равных. Все на свете ему удавалось лучше всего. И она нисколько не сомневалась, что ни один стрелок в стране не сможет больше его настрелять птиц первого сентября<a href="#ref4" class="a" onclick="save();">[36]</a>.</p>
<p>Как-то раз, вскоре после приезда, сидя утром в обществе двух старших сестер, Лидия сказала, обращаясь к Элизабет:</p>
<p>— А ведь ты еще не знаешь, как мы поженились. Когда я говорила про это маме и сестрам, ты куда-то исчезла. Рассказать тебе, как все происходило?</p>
<p>— Пожалуй, не стоит, — ответила Элизабет. — Чем меньше мы будем вспоминать об этих вещах, тем лучше.</p>
<p>— Фу, какая ты странная! Я тебе непременно расскажу все по порядку. Нас поженили в церкви святого Климента — дом, где жил Уикхем, находится в этом приходе. Всем полагалось собраться к одиннадцати. Я должна была ехать с дядей и тетей, а остальные — встретить нас перед церковью. Когда наконец наступил понедельник, я безумно волновалась — все чудилось, словно что-то случится, свадьбу отложат и я останусь ни с чем. А тут еще, пока я одевалась, эти тетушкины разговоры и поучения. Будто она проповедь читает! Правда, до меня доходило не больше одного слова из десяти. Ты сама понимаешь, я могла думать только о моем дорогом Уикхеме: до смерти хотелось угадать — наденет ли он синий мундир?</p>
<p>Так вот, в десять, как всегда, мы уселись за завтрак. Мне казалось, он никогда не кончится. Дядюшка и тетушка, должна тебе, кстати, признаться, обращались со мной, пока я у них жила, из рук вон плохо. Поверишь ли, за две недели я ни разу не выбралась из дому. Ни одного визита, развлечения или чего-то еще! В Лондоне, правда, было довольно пусто, но ведь Малый театр<a href="#ref3" class="a" onclick="save();">[37]</a> оставался открытым. И можешь себе представить, когда подали наконец карету, дядю как раз вызвал по делу этот ужасный мистер Стоун. Ты ведь знаешь, когда они сойдутся вдвоем, конца не дождешься. Я была в отчаянии, просто не знала, что делать, — дядя должен был быть моим посаженым отцом, а если бы мы опоздали, в этот день нас бы не поженили. К счастью, через десять минут дядя освободился, и мы поехали. Потом-то я сообразила: если бы он и задержался, ничего можно было не откладывать, потому что его вполне мог заменить мистер Дарси.</p>
<p>— Мистер Дарси? — повторила Элизабет в крайнем изумлении.</p>
<p>— Ну конечно. Он должен был прийти с моим дорогим Уикхемом. Ах, боже мой, я забыла! Об этом же нельзя говорить! С меня взяли честное слово. Что скажет Уикхем? Это же тайна!</p>
<p>— Если это тайна, — сказала Джейн, — то не говори больше ни слова. Можешь быть уверена, я не стану ее у тебя выпытывать.</p>
<p>— О, конечно, — согласилась Элизабет, сгорая от любопытства. — Мы не зададим тебе никаких вопросов.</p>
<p>— Спасибо, девочки, — сказала Лидия. — Если бы вы вздумали меня расспрашивать, я бы все выболтала. И мой дорогой Уикхем страшно бы на меня разозлился.</p>
<p>Чтобы избавить себя от столь сильного соблазна, Элизабет сочла за лучшее немедленно удалиться.</p>
<p>Но оставаться в неведении было совершенно невыносимо. Во всяком случае, она не в силах была удержаться от попытки разузнать хоть какие-то подробности. Мистер Дарси присутствовал на свадьбе ее сестры! Это была как раз та обстановка и те люди, с которыми у него не было ничего общего и которые не могли вызывать у него ни малейшего интереса. Предположения о том, что бы это могло означать, самые смелые и причудливые, не выходили у нее из головы. Но ни одно из них не казалось ей правдоподобным. Те, которые были для нее наиболее лестными и выставляли его поведение в особенно благородном свете, казались ей наиболее невероятными. Она не могла больше выносить такую неопределенность. И, схватив листок бумаги, она тут же написала несколько слов миссис Гардинер, умоляя ее объяснить оброненную Лидией фразу, если только это совместимо с предполагаемой тайной.</p>
<p>«Вы легко можете себе представить, — писала она, — насколько мне любопытно узнать, каким образом человек, ни с кем из нас не связанный и почти чужой для нашей семьи, мог оказаться среди вас в подобную минуту. Ради бога, напишите сразу и объясните мне все, если только по каким-нибудь бесспорным причинам это не должно быть, как думает Лидия, от меня скрыто. В последнем случае мне придется навсегда остаться в мучительном неведении».</p>
<p>«Впрочем, как бы не так, — добавила она про себя, заканчивая письмо. — И если, любезная моя тетушка, вы не раскроете правды по-хорошему, я, чтобы ее выведать, буду вынуждена прибегнуть к хитростям и уловкам».</p>
<p>Деликатность и особое чувство такта не позволили Джейн поговорить с Элизабет о словах, случайно брошенных Лидией. Элизабет была этому рада. До того, как выяснится, сможет ли она получить разъяснения от тетушки, она предпочитала обходиться без поверенного.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА Х</p>
</div>
<p>К радости Элизабет, ответное письмо пришло без промедления. Едва получив его, она поспешила в небольшую рощу, где ее меньше всего могли потревожить, и уселась на одной из скамеек, предвкушая несколько счастливых минут. В самом деле, письмо было настолько обширным, что не могло заключать в себе просто отказ удовлетворить ее любопытство.</p>
<p><em>«Грейсчёрч-стрит, 6 сентября</em></p>
<p>Дорогая племянница, только что получила твое письмо. Предвидя, что не смогу сжать до нескольких строк то, что мне необходимо тебе сообщить, я решила пожертвовать для ответа целым утром. Признаюсь, твое обращение застигло меня врасплох. Я не ожидала ничего подобного. Пожалуйста, не думай, что оно сколько-нибудь меня рассердило, — просто я никак не предполагала, что ты можешь задать мне такой вопрос. Если ты предпочитаешь меня не понимать, прости мою бестактность. Твой дядя удивлен не меньше моего, — только уверенность, что ты причастна ко всем происходившим событиям, позволила ему сделать то, что он сделал. Но если ты и правда ничего не знаешь и ни к чему не имела отношения, мне следует выразиться яснее. В тот самый день, когда я вернулась домой из Лонгборна, твоему дяде нанес визит неожиданный посетитель. Придя к нам, мистер Дарси провел с дядей наедине несколько часов. Их разговор к моему приезду уже закончился, так что мне совсем не пришлось страдать от любопытства, которое тебя, видимо, подвергло столь длительному испытанию. Целью его прихода было сообщить мистеру Гардинеру, что ему удалось обнаружить местопребывание твоей сестры и мистера Уикхема. Он также смог повидаться и поговорить с обоими: с Лидией один, а с Уикхемом — несколько раз. Насколько я поняла, он покинул Дербишир на следующий же день после нашего отъезда оттуда и прибыл в Лондон, чтобы выследить беглецов. Свой поступок он объясняет тем, что это, дескать, из-за него низость Уикхема не подверглась разоблачению, которое предостерегло бы достойных молодых леди от опасности им увлечься и довериться подобному человеку. Великодушно считая причиной всего происшедшего свою ложную гордость, он признает, что прежде находил ниже своего достоинства раскрыть перед миром обстоятельства, которые относились, казалось бы, к нему одному. Люди должны были знать, с кем им приходится иметь дело. Поэтому мистер Дарси счел своим долгом вмешаться и попытался исправить зло, причиненное при его попустительстве. Если он руководствовался также и другими побуждениями, я не считаю, что это можно поставить ему в упрек. Он провел в городе несколько дней, прежде чем ему удалось разыскать беглецов. Но в его розысках ему могли помочь некоторые не известные нам обстоятельства. И сознание этого своего преимущества было еще одной причиной, побудившей его отправиться вслед за нами. Существует некая дама по имени миссис Янг, служившая прежде гувернанткой при мисс Дарси и отстраненная от этой должности за какой-то проступок, о котором мистер Дарси предпочел умолчать. С тех пор она добывает средства к существованию, сдавая меблированные комнаты в большом доме, приобретенном ею на Эдвард-стрит. Как было известно мистеру Дарси, дама эта близко знакома с Уикхемом. Поэтому тотчас по приезде в город мистер Дарси отправился за сведениями к миссис Янг. Он смог добиться от нее того, что ему было нужно, только два или три дня спустя. По-видимому, она не соглашалась без внушительного подкупа пренебречь оказанным ей доверием, так как на самом деле прекрасно знала о местонахождении ее приятеля. Уикхем и вправду сразу по прибытии в Лондон явился прямо к ней и здесь бы и остался, если бы только у нее была для него свободная комната. В конце концов наш добрый друг все же вырвал у этой особы требовавшиеся ему сведения. Выяснилось, что они остановились на *** стрит. Он повидал Уикхема и после этого добился свидания с Лидией. По его словам, при этой встрече он прежде всего хотел убедить ее отказаться от своего позорного положения и вернуться к родным, как только они будут готовы ее принять. При этом он предложил ей возможное содействие. Лидия, однако, была полна решимости остаться там, где находилась. Ей не было никакого дела до родственников, она не желала от них никакой помощи и даже слышать не хотела о том, чтобы расстаться с Уикхемом. Она была уверена, что рано или поздно они поженятся, и вовсе не придавала сколько-нибудь серьезного значения тому, когда именно это произойдет. При таком ее взгляде на вещи он рассудил, что не остается другого выхода, как договориться об их бракосочетании и всячески ускорить это событие. Из первой беседы с Уикхемом он понял, что женитьба вовсе не входила в намерения молодого человека, который признался, что весьма обременительные долги чести вынудили его покинуть полк, и не постеснялся свалить все злосчастные обстоятельства побега Лидии на ее легкомыслие. Он собирался уйти в отставку и имел весьма туманное представление о своем будущем. Предполагалось, что он куда-нибудь уедет, хотя отнюдь не было известно, куда именно. Вместе с тем было ясно, что у него нет никаких средств к существованию. Мистер Дарси поинтересовался причинами, из-за которых он сразу не женился на твоей сестре. Хотя мистера Беннета нельзя считать очень богатым человеком, он все же мог бы в какой-то мере оказаться ему полезным и эта женитьба отразилась бы выгодно на его положении. Но ответ Уикхема на этот вопрос свидетельствовал, что молодой человек лелеял надежду поправить свои дела основательно с помощью женитьбы в новых местах. При таких обстоятельствах ему, однако, трудно было устоять против соблазнительного предложения, которое могло его выручить сразу. Они встретились не один раз — столько всего необходимо было обсудить. Уикхем, разумеется, запросил больше того, на что мог рассчитывать, но в конце концов ограничился разумными требованиями. Как только между ними была достигнута договоренность, мистер Дарси тотчас же поспешил ознакомить с положением дел твоего дядю и зашел на Грейсчёрч-стрит вечером накануне моего приезда. Однако ему не удалось застать мистера Гардинера. А из ответов прислуги он узнал, что твой отец все еще находится здесь, но должен уехать на следующее утро. Считая, что с ним ему будет не столь легко объясниться, как с мистером Гардинером, он охотно отложил свой визит до отъезда мистера Беннета в Лонгборн. Он не назвал своего имени, и до следующего дня было известно только, что некий господин наведывался к дяде по делу. В субботу он явился опять. Твоего отца уже не было<a href="#ref2" class="a" onclick="save();">[38]</a>, дядя находился дома, и, как сказано было выше, между ними произошел весьма продолжительный разговор. В воскресенье они встретились снова, и тогда мне тоже довелось его повидать. Но обо всем договориться они смогли только в понедельник, после чего в Лонгборн немедленно был отправлен нарочный. Наш гость оказался очень упрямым человеком. Думаю, Лиззи, что истинным недостатком его характера в конце концов является именно упрямство. В разное время ему приписывались различные пороки. Но этот порок присущ ему на самом деле. Все, что еще предстояло сделать, должно было быть сделано только им самим, хоть я убеждена (говорю вовсе не для того, чтобы заслужить благодарность, и поэтому, пожалуйста, ни слова об этом), что твой дядя охотно бы взялся за дело сам. Они спорили между собой по этому поводу гораздо больше, чем того стоили девица и молодой человек, к которым эти споры относились. Но в конце концов дяде пришлось уступить, и, вместо того чтобы оказаться полезным своей племяннице, он, вопреки своему желанию, вынужден был только изобразить благодетеля, не будучи им на самом деле. И я искренне убеждена, что полученное от тебя сегодня утром письмо весьма его обрадовало, так как потребовало разъяснений, которые избавляют его от не принадлежавших ему лавров и отдают их лицу, заслуживающему их на самом деле. Но, милая Лиззи, все это не должно пойти дальше тебя и, в крайнем случае, дальше Джейн. Ты, я думаю, достаточно хорошо знаешь, что было сделано для жениха и невесты. Следовало выплатить его долги на общую сумму, наверно, далеко перевалившую за тысячу фунтов. Другая тысяча, вместе с ее собственной, была положена на имя Лидии. А для него был куплен патент. Причину, по которой все это взял на себя мистер Дарси, я уже назвала тебе раньше. Только по его вине, из-за его бездействия и недостаточной дальновидности характер Уикхема выступал в столь ложном свете и он мог пользоваться всеобщим вниманием и расположением. Быть может, в этом и содержится крупица истины. Однако, несмотря на прекрасные рассуждения, ты, моя дорогая Лиззи, можешь быть абсолютно уверена, что дядя ни за что бы с ними не согласился, не будь он убежден в особой заинтересованности мистера Дарси в этом деле. Когда все вопросы были разрешены, мистер Дарси вернулся к своим друзьям, еще остававшимся в Пемберли. Но при этом было условлено, что он снова прибудет в Лондон в день бракосочетания, с тем чтобы полностью закончить денежные дела. Думаю, я рассказала теперь решительно все. Это сообщение, как я поняла из твоего письма, должно тебя сильно удивить. Надеюсь все же, оно не вызовет твоего неудовольствия. Лидия переселилась к нам, и Уикхем получил постоянный доступ в наш дом. Он был точно таким же, каким я его знала в Хартфордшире. Но я ни за что не стала бы говорить тебе о своем недовольстве поведением в нашем доме невесты, если бы не поняла из письма, написанного Джейн в последнюю среду, что она ведет себя в Лонгборне точно так же, как и у нас, и потому это мое сообщение не может причинить тебе новой боли. Много раз я заводила с ней разговор, пытаясь самым серьезным образом объяснить ей непорядочность ее поведения и зло, которое она причинила своей семье.</p>
<p>Я была бы рада, если бы что-нибудь все же было ею усвоено, так как она явно старалась не слышать моих слов. Иногда я выходила из себя. Но тогда я вспоминала своих дорогих Элизабет и Джейн и ради них старалась набраться терпения. Мистер Дарси вернулся точно в назначенное время и, как тебе известно от Лидии, присутствовал при церковном обряде. Он пообедал у нас на следующий день и должен был снова покинуть Лондон в среду или в четверг. Надеюсь, дорогая Лиззи, ты не очень рассердишься, если я воспользуюсь поводом и признаюсь тебе (чего я никак не решалась сделать до этих пор), насколько он мне понравился. Его обращение с нами было во всех отношениях таким же милым, как тогда, когда мы находились в Дербишире. Его взгляды и здравый смысл кажутся мне безукоризненными. Если ему чего-то и недостает, так это некоторой живости характера, которую в нем могла бы воспитать спутница жизни, при условии, что он сделает удачный выбор. Он показался мне человеком скрытным — едва ли хоть раз он упомянул о тебе. Но ведь скрытность теперь принята. Ради Бога, прости мне мои, быть может, преждевременные намеки. И, по крайней мере, не рассердись на меня настолько, чтобы в будущем закрыть передо мной двери в П. Я не почувствую себя вполне счастливой до тех пор, пока не осмотрю весь парк целиком. Думаю, для этого отлично подошел бы низенький фаэтон с парой хорошеньких пони. Но я не могу больше писать — уже полчаса назад мне следовало заняться детьми.</p>
<p>Искренне преданная тебе</p>
<p><em>М. Гардинер».</em></p>
<p>Содержание этого письма вызвало в душе Элизабет целую бурю переживаний, радостных и мучительных, — трудно было даже определить, какие из них преобладали. Прежние смутные и неопределенные догадки, вызванные неясностью роли Дарси в подготовке бракосочетания ее сестры, над которыми она даже не смела задумываться — они предполагали проявление такого необыкновенного великодушия и вместе с тем накладывали на нее столь серьезные обязательства, — подтвердились, притом в самой полной мере! Он намеренно отправился искать их в Лондон, готовый ко всем неприятностям и унижениям, связанным с подобными розысками! Снизошел до роли просителя перед женщиной, которую презирал и ненавидел! Был вынужден видеть (притом не один раз), уговаривать и, наконец, подкупить человека, которого всегда избегал, — даже самое имя которого выводило его из себя! И все это делалось для девчонки, которую он не мог ни уважать, ни ценить? Сердце подсказывало Элизабет, что он поступал так ради нее. Но подобное предположение сразу оказывалось несостоятельным, когда она думала о том, что даже при всей своей самонадеянности она не может рассчитывать на его привязанность к той, которая однажды ответила ему отказом, — пусть даже ему удалось бы преодолеть в себе естественное отвращение при одной мысли о необходимости породниться с Уикхемом. Свояк Уикхема! Всякое чувство гордости должно было восстать против такого родства. Разумеется, он сделал очень много. Ей было совестно даже представить себе сколько. Но ведь он предложил объяснение своего вмешательства, в которое можно было поверить без особой натяжки. Казалось вполне разумным, что он испытывал чувство вины. Он был щедр и имел возможность проявить это качество. И хотя его прежнюю склонность к ней она не могла считать главным его побуждением, остатки этого чувства могли все же способствовать его стараниям в деле, от которого столь сильно зависело ее душевное спокойствие. Как тяжело, как мучительно было сознавать, сколь многим обязаны они были человеку, с которым им никогда не удастся расплатиться. Спасение Лидии, ее имени и чести — все это было делом его рук. О, как горько раскаивалась она теперь в каждой своей недоброй мысли об этом человеке, в каждой обращенной к нему вызывающей фразе! Себя она чувствовала униженной. Но она была горда за него, горда тем, что он превзошел самого себя в проявлении великодушия и благородства. Она снова и снова перечитывала в письме отзыв о нем миссис Гардинер. Едва ли он был полным, но он был ей по-настоящему дорог. Она даже испытывала некоторую радость, смешанную с сожалением, думая об уверенности Гардинеров в том, что она связана с мистером Дарси доверием и взаимной привязанностью.</p>
<p>Ее заставил оторваться от раздумий и встать со скамьи шум шагов. И, прежде чем она углубилась в соседнюю аллею, ее догнал Уикхем.</p>
<p>— Боюсь, сестрица, я не вовремя прервал вашу одинокую прогулку, — сказал он, подходя.</p>
<p>— Вы в самом деле ее прервали, — ответила она с улыбкой. — Но отсюда вовсе не следует, что это произошло не вовремя.</p>
<p>— Если бы это было так, меня бы это очень огорчило. Мы ведь всегда были добрыми друзьями, а теперь стали еще лучшими, не правда ли?</p>
<p>— Да, разумеется. Кто-нибудь еще вышел прогуляться?</p>
<p>— Не знаю. Лидия с матерью поехали в Меритон. Итак, сестрица, как я понял из слов дяди и тети, вы все-таки навестили Пемберли.</p>
<p>Она ответила утвердительно.</p>
<p>— Я почти вам завидую. И все же мне это, наверно, было бы слишком тяжело, — в противном случае я вполне мог бы туда заехать по пути в Ньюкасл. Вы, должно быть, повидали старую экономку? Бедная Рейнолдс, она меня так любила! Конечно, вам она обо мне ничего не сказала.</p>
<p>— О нет, кое-что было сказано.</p>
<p>— Что же именно?</p>
<p>— Что вы поступили в армию и, кажется, не вполне хорошо себя там зарекомендовали. На большом расстоянии, вы знаете, многое бывает искажено.</p>
<p>— В самом деле, — произнес он, кусая губы.</p>
<p>Элизабет надеялась, что ей удалось заставить его замолчать. Но вскоре он заговорил опять:</p>
<p>— Я был удивлен, увидев недавно в Лондоне Дарси. Мы встретились с ним несколько раз. Интересно, чем он там занимается?</p>
<p>— Может быть, он готовится к свадьбе с мисс де Бёр? — спросила Элизабет. — В такое время года его могло привести в город только что-нибудь из ряда вон выходящее.</p>
<p>— Несомненно. Пришлось ли вам повидать его во время вашего пребывания в Лэмтоне? Из слов Гардинеров мне показалось, что вы встретились?</p>
<p>— О да, и он познакомил нас со своей сестрой.</p>
<p>— Она вам понравилась?</p>
<p>— Конечно, и даже очень.</p>
<p>— Я в самом деле слышал, что за два года она стала намного лучше. Когда я ее видел в последний раз, она больших надежд не внушала. Рад, что она вам пришлась по душе. Хотелось бы надеяться, что с ней и дальше все пойдет хорошо.</p>
<p>— О, я в этом вполне уверена. Ведь самые опасные годы для нее позади, не так ли?</p>
<p>— Вы проезжали деревню Кимтон?</p>
<p>— Не припомню такого названия.</p>
<p>— Я спросил про нее потому, что это тот самый приход, на который я мог рассчитывать. Дивное место! Отличный пасторский домик! Это так бы мне сейчас подошло.</p>
<p>— И вы стали бы произносить проповеди?</p>
<p>— О, с величайшим наслаждением! Они сделались бы частью моего существования; привыкнув, я бы с ними легко справлялся. Нехорошо жаловаться, но иногда все же думаешь — насколько это было бы славно! Спокойствие и уединение — вот, по-моему, настоящее счастье. Увы, этому не бывать. Вам Дарси об этом ничего не рассказывал, когда вы гостили в Кенте?</p>
<p>— От человека не менее осведомленного я слышала, что приход был оставлен за вами только условно. Окончательное решение возлагалось на теперешнего владельца.</p>
<p>— Гм, вот как! Да, это в какой-то степени верно. Я даже, помнится, что-то вам об этом сказал, когда мы впервые разговорились.</p>
<p>— Я слышала также, что в былое время произнесение проповедей не выглядело для вас столь приятным занятием, каким оно представляется вам сейчас. И что тогда вы решительно и навсегда отказались от прихода, получив соответствующую компенсацию.</p>
<p>— Ах так?! Это, впрочем, тоже не лишено оснований. Вы можете вспомнить, что и об этом я говорил вам при нашем первом знакомстве.</p>
<p>Они уже находились у самого входа в дом, так как Элизабет шла быстро, с тем чтобы поскорее от него отделаться. Щадя сестру и не желая ради нее с ним ссориться, она только ответила ему с веселой улыбкой:</p>
<p>— Послушайте, мистер Уикхем, мы с вами теперь, как вы знаете, брат и сестра. Не будем вспоминать прошлое. В будущем, я надеюсь, мы обо всем станем судить одинаково.</p>
<p>Она протянула Уикхему руку, которую тот, не зная, куда отвести глаза, весьма галантно поцеловал, и они вошли в дом.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XI</p>
</div>
<p>Мистер Уикхем был в такой степени удовлетворен этой беседой, что больше никогда не затруднял себя попытками растрогать дорогую сестрицу Элизабет жалобами на свою горькую участь. И она с радостью убедилась в том, что ей удалось высказать все необходимое, чтобы заставить его замолчать.</p>
<p>Вскоре наступил день отъезда его и Лидии, и миссис Беннет не оставалось ничего другого, как примириться с предстоящей разлукой, которая, по-видимому, должна была продлиться не менее года, так как ее муж и слышать не хотел о поездке в Ньюкасл.</p>
<p>— Лидия, дорогая моя, — воскликнула она, — когда-то теперь доведется нам снова встретиться!</p>
<p>— Боже мой, откуда я знаю? Быть может, не раньше чем через два или даже три года.</p>
<p>— Пиши мне, любовь моя, как можно чаще.</p>
<p>— Уж как сумею. Вы знаете, у замужних женщин остается немного времени для писем. Пусть мне побольше пишут сестры. Им-то ведь делать нечего.</p>
<p>Мистер Уикхем простился с родными гораздо сердечнее. Он расточал улыбки, очаровывал всех и произнес массу приятных слов.</p>
<p>— Это самый отличный малый из виденных мной на моем веку, — заметил мистер Беннет, как только они уехали. — Ухмыляется, хихикает и со всеми заигрывает! Я необыкновенно им горд. Думается, даже сам сэр Уильям Лукас не смог бы породить более достойного зятя.</p>
<p>Отъезд дочери на несколько дней выбил миссис Беннет из колеи.</p>
<p>— Мне часто приходит в голову, — говорила она, — что на свете нет ничего хуже разлуки с родным человеком. Как пусто становится, когда его уже нет рядом!</p>
<p>— Вот к чему приводит, сударыня, замужество дочки, — заметила Элизабет. — Тем больше удовлетворения вы должны находить в том, что остальные ваши дочери остаются в девицах.</p>
<p>— Ничего подобного! Лидия покинула нас сейчас не из-за своего замужества, а лишь потому, что полк Уикхема находится бог знает как далеко. Если бы он был поближе, она бы так быстро не уехала.</p>
<p>Отчаяние, в которое миссис Беннет была ввергнута этим событием, мало-помалу, однако, потеряло свою остроту, и она стала питать новые надежды благодаря одному недавно распространившемуся известию. Экономка в Незерфилде получила распоряжение приготовить дом к приезду хозяина, прибывающего через день или два, чтобы в течение нескольких недель поохотиться в здешних местах. Миссис Беннет пришла в крайнее беспокойство. Она то и дело поглядывала на Джейн, улыбалась и качала головой.</p>
<p>— Так, так, сестрица, — новость сообщила ей миссис Филипс, — значит, мистер Бингли все-таки возвращается? Ну что ж, тем лучше. Хотя меня это мало трогает. Он ведь для нас, как тебе известно, никто, и мне вовсе не хотелось его снова увидеть. Все же его появление в Незерфилде, если он вздумал туда возвратиться, — дело похвальное. Кто знает, что может случиться? Впрочем, нас это не касается, мы же условились никогда об этом не вспоминать. Ты уверена, что он приезжает?</p>
<p>— Можешь на меня положиться, — отвечала ее сестра. — Миссис Николс была вечером в Меритоне. Я как увидела, что она идет мимо, сразу выбежала, чтобы все разузнать. Она сама говорит, что все это чистая правда. Он приезжает не позже четверга, может быть даже в среду. По словам миссис Николс, она заходила к мяснику, чтобы заказать мяса к среде. К счастью, у него нашлось три пары уток, которым самое время свернуть головы и отправить на кухню.</p>
<p>Известие о приезде Бингли не могло не вызвать краску на лице у мисс Беннет. Уже много месяцев прошло с тех пор, как она в последний раз произнесла его имя в разговоре с Элизабет. Но теперь, как только они остались вдвоем, она сказала:</p>
<p>— Я заметила, как ты на меня взглянула, когда тетя сообщила нам последнюю новость. Наверно, я показалась расстроенной. Но не считай, пожалуйста, что это было связано с какими-нибудь глупостями. Просто я на минуту смутилась, так как понимала, что все обратят на меня внимание. Эта новость не вызвала в моей душе ни боли, ни радости. Приятно, что он приезжает один, — благодаря этому мы почти не будем встречаться. Не то чтобы я опасалась за себя, но я боюсь всяких намеков.</p>
<p>Элизабет не знала, что и подумать. Если бы она не встретилась с ним в Дербишире, она считала бы, что он мог приехать ради того, о чем было объявлено во всеуслышание. Но там ей показалось, что он любит Джейн по-прежнему. И она терялась в догадках, стараясь понять, приезжает ли он с разрешения друга или осмелился действовать по своему усмотрению.</p>
<p>«И все же это ужасно, — думала она иногда. — Несчастный молодой человек не смеет поселиться в законно нанятом доме, не вызвав подобных сплетен. По мне — пусть он живет, как ему вздумается».</p>
<p>Хотя Джейн говорила, что известие о приезде Бингли ничуть ее не тревожит, и даже верила в это сама, Элизабет все же ясно замечала ее волнение. В каждом ее поступке обнаруживались взвинченность, нервозность, столь несвойственные ей в обычное время.</p>
<p>Тема, подвергнутая горячему семейному обсуждению около года тому назад, вновь стала предметом разговора между родителями.</p>
<p>— Дорогой мой, как только мистер Бингли приедет, — сказала миссис Беннет, — вам, разумеется, нужно будет его навестить!</p>
<p>— Ну нет, увольте. В прошлом году вы меня убедили, обещав, что за это он женится на нашей дочке. Но, как видите, все кончилось ничем. На эту удочку я больше не попадусь.</p>
<p>Жена попыталась объяснить ему, что по случаю приезда мистера Бингли все соседи должны оказать ему должное внимание.</p>
<p>— Терпеть не могу этикета! — возразил муж. — Если Бингли нуждается в нашем обществе — пусть сам и заботится о встрече. Он знает, где мы живем. Я слишком дорожу временем, чтобы бегать к соседям по случаю каждого их отъезда или приезда.</p>
<p>— Ну что ж, насколько я понимаю, вы поступите непростительно грубо. Но это все же ни в коем случае не помешает мне пригласить его к нам на обед. На днях у нас обедают Голдинги и миссис Лонг. Вместе с нами за столом будет тринадцать человек, — для него как раз останется место.</p>
<p>Принятый план помог ей смириться с недостаточной учтивостью мужа. И все же ей было тяжело сознавать, что из-за его отказа соседи смогут встретиться с мистером Бингли раньше, чем они.</p>
<p>— Я вообще начинаю жалеть о его возвращении, — сказала Джейн сестре. — Оно могло бы меня не затрагивать, — ведь я и впрямь могу с ним встретиться как ни в чем не бывало. Но я не переношу связанных с этим беспрестанных разговоров. У нашей матери самые добрые намерения. Но она не представляет себе, — этого не может представить никто, — как мучат меня ее слова. Я буду счастлива, когда он снова уедет.</p>
<p>— Мне бы хотелось тебя утешить, — ответила Элизабет. — Но я не могу. Пойми, дорогая. Я не могу даже пожелать тебе набраться терпения, — то, что в таких случаях обычно советуют, — столько ты вытерпела.</p>
<p>Мистер Бингли приехал. С помощью слуг миссис Беннет узнала об этом незамедлительно, благодаря чему не был упущен ни один час возможных волнений и беспокойств. И она высчитывала, через сколько дней будет прилично пригласить его на задуманный обед, не надеясь увидеть его до этого. Но уже на третье утро после его прибытия к Хартфордшир она заметила из окна спальни, как он въехал на прилегающую к дому лужайку и поскакал к подъезду.</p>
<p>На радостях она сейчас же подозвала к окну дочерей. Джейн не захотела покинуть места за столом. Но Элизабет, чтобы ублажить мать, подошла, посмотрела на двор, увидела рядом с Бингли мистера Дарси и села рядом со старшей сестрой.</p>
<p>— С ним какой-то джентльмен, маменька, — сказала Китти. — Кто бы это мог быть?</p>
<p>— Какой-нибудь его знакомый, моя дорогая, — откуда мне знать.</p>
<p>— Ой! — крикнула Китти. — Кажется, это тот самый джентльмен, который всюду бывал с ним раньше. Мистер, ну как же его зовут, — такой высокий и гордый?..</p>
<p>— Боже праведный! Мистер Дарси! Конечно, он, клянусь чем угодно. Что ж, мы рады приветствовать всякого друга мистера Бингли. Но не будь они друзьями, я бы сказала, что прихожу в ярость от одного его вида.</p>
<p>Джейн бросила на Элизабет взгляд, полный недоумения и сочувствия. Она почти ничего не знала о том, что произошло в Дербишире. Поэтому она представила себе смущение сестры, которая едва ли не впервые увидела этого человека после получения от него столь памятного письма. Обеим сестрам было очень не по себе. Обеих переполняли собственные переживания и взаимное сочувствие. Поэтому они не расслышали болтовни матери о ее неприязни к мистеру Дарси и решимости обращаться с ним учтиво только ради его дружбы с мистером Бингли. Но у Элизабет был повод для беспокойства, совершенно неизвестный сестре, которой она так и не осмелилась показать письмо миссис Гардинер и рассказать, как изменилось ее отношение к Дарси. Для Джейн это был просто человек, на предложение которого ее сестра ответила отказом и достоинства которого недооценила. Но Элизабет знала гораздо больше. Она видела в нем друга, который облагодетельствовал их семью и к которому она питала чувство если не столь же нежное, то, по крайней мере, не менее оправданное и заслуженное, чем чувство Джейн к Бингли. Его приезд, появление в Незерфилде и в Лонгборне, его явное стремление снова с ней встретиться — все это удивляло ее почти в той же степени, в какой она была удивлена переменой его поведения при первой их встрече в Дербишире.</p>
<p>Румянец, сошедший перед тем с ее щек, вспыхнул на них еще ярче, и радостная улыбка озарила ее лицо, когда она подумала, как долго остаются неизменными его привязанность и стремление завоевать ее сердце. Но она не хотела себя зря обнадеживать.</p>
<p>«Посмотрим прежде, как он станет себя вести, — сказала она себе. — Помечтать мы еще успеем».</p>
<p>Она сидела, углубившись в работу, стараясь совладать с душевным смятением и не смея поднять глаза. Услышав приближающиеся к двери шаги, она с любопытством взглянула на сидевшую рядом сестру. Джейн была немного бледна, но держалась спокойнее, чем ожидала Элизабет. При появлении гостей она слегка покраснела. И все же она встретила их непринужденно, и в ее полном достоинства поведении не замечалось ни тени обиды или преувеличенной приветливости.</p>
<p>Элизабет сказала каждому из друзей ровно столько, сколько требовали приличия, и снова взялась за шитье. Только раз осмелилась она бросить взгляд на Дарси. Как обычно, он казался серьезным, и она подумала, что сейчас он больше похож на Дарси, которого она видела прежде в Хартфордшире, чем на того, которого узнала в Пемберли. Но, быть может, находясь рядом с ее матерью, он не мог вести себя так, как в присутствии ее дяди и тети? Такое предположение, сколь оно ни было огорчительным, казалось правдоподобным.</p>
<p>На Бингли она тоже успела взглянуть лишь мельком, заметив при этом, что он выглядит счастливым и смущенным. Миссис Беннет встретила его с такой чрезмерной любезностью, что старшим дочкам стало неловко, в особенности из-за контраста между этим приемом и церемонным приветствием, которым она удостоила его друга.</p>
<p>Это различие особенно болезненно переживала Элизабет, знавшая, что миссис Беннет была обязана мистеру Дарси спасением от бесчестия любимой дочери.</p>
<p>Дарси справился у Элизабет о здоровье мистера и миссис Гардинер, смутив ее настолько, что она едва смогла ответить, и затем не проронил почти ни одного слова. Они сидели довольно далеко друг от друга, и его молчание, возможно, объяснялось именно этим. Но в Дербишире все было по-другому. Там, если он не мог разговаривать с ней, он беседовал с ее друзьями. Здесь же в течение многих минут его голоса вовсе не было слышно. И когда, одолеваемая любопытством, она время от времени бросала на него беглые взгляды, она замечала, что он одинаково часто смотрел на нее и на Джейн, а еще чаще — просто опускал глаза. Его озабоченность и меньшая, в сравнении с предыдущей встречей, готовность быть ей приятным объяснялись достаточно просто. Она была разочарована и жестоко за это на себя злилась.</p>
<p>«Разве я могла ждать иного? — спрашивала она себя. — И все же почему он пришел?»</p>
<p>Ей не хотелось разговаривать с кем-нибудь другим, и у нее не хватало духу обратиться к нему. Справившись о здоровье его сестры, она больше ничего не могла придумать.</p>
<p>— Как давно вы уехали, мистер Бингли! — заметила миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>Мистер Бингли с готовностью согласился.</p>
<p>— Я уже начала побаиваться, что вы и вовсе не вернетесь. Поговаривали, будто к Михайлову дню вы откажетесь от аренды. Надеюсь, этого не случится? Как много за ваше отсутствие изменилось! Мисс Лукас вышла замуж и теперь живет своим домом. И одна из моих дочерей — тоже. Надеюсь, вы слышали — вы могли об этом прочесть в газетах. Я знаю, об этом сообщалось в «Курьере» и в «Таймсе». Хотя, конечно, не так, как следовало бы. Сказано всего лишь: «На днях Джордж Уикхем, эсквайр — на мисс Лидии Беннет». И ни словечка об ее отце, из каких она мест, — ровно ничего. Это дело рук моего братца Гардинера. Просто понять не могу, как его угораздило так оскандалиться. Вы читали?</p>
<p>Бингли ответил утвердительно и воспользовался случаем принести свои поздравления. Элизабет не смела поднять глаза, а потому не знала, как при этом выглядел мистер Дарси.</p>
<p>— В самом деле приятно, когда дочка удачно выходит замуж, — продолжала миссис Беннет. — И вместе с тем было жестоко отрывать ее от меня. Они уехали далеко на север, в Ньюкасл. И, увы, будут жить в тех местах бог знает сколько. Там квартирует его полк. Вы ведь, надеюсь, знаете, — он ушел из ***ширского и поступил в регулярную армию. Слава богу, у него есть настоящие друзья. Хоть и не так много, как он заслуживает.</p>
<p>Элизабет, понимавшая, что это говорилось в пику мистеру Дарси, почувствовала себя до такой степени униженной, что едва могла усидеть на месте. Но именно эти слова наполнили ее душу недостававшей ей прежде решимостью и заставили ее вступить в разговор. Она спросила у Бингли, надолго ли он поселился в Незерфилде, и узнала, что он надеется провести здесь несколько недель.</p>
<p>— Когда вы перестреляете всю дичь у себя, — вмешалась ее мамаша, — пожалуйста, мистер Бингли, приезжайте к нам. Вы сможете сколько угодно охотиться в имении мистера Беннета. Поверьте, он будет счастлив доставить вам это удовольствие и постарается приберечь для вас лучшие выводки.</p>
<p>Неумеренная и назойливая угодливость матери еще сильнее смутила Элизабет. Она была убеждена, что если бы сейчас ожили вновь прошлогодние надежды, то все очень скоро опять завершилось бы досадным разочарованием. И ей казалось, что мука, которую в эти минуты испытывали она и Джейн, не могла быть возмещена даже годами блаженства.</p>
<p>«Самое большое мое желание, — говорила она себе, — никогда больше не видеть этих людей. Своим обществом они не доставляют той радости, ради которой стоило бы переносить такие страдания. Пусть же ни тот, ни другой не попадаются мне на пути!»</p>
<p>Мука, которая не могла быть возмещена годами блаженства, показалась ей все же менее тяжкой, когда она заметила, как сильно обаяние Джейн действует на чувства ее прежнего поклонника. Сразу по приходе он разговаривал с ней немного. Но с каждой минутой его внимание к ней росло. Она казалась ему такой же красивой, как в прошлом году. Такой же милой и такой же естественной, но, пожалуй, несколько более молчаливой. Джейн всячески заботилась, чтобы в ней не было заметно никаких перемен, и считала, что разговаривает столько же, сколько раньше. Но ее мысль работала так напряженно, что нередко она сама не замечала своей задумчивости.</p>
<p>Когда молодые люди собрались уходить, миссис Беннет, продолжая изо всех сил ухаживать за Бингли, воспользовалась случаем, чтобы пригласить их в один из ближайших дней пообедать в Лонгборне.</p>
<p>— Ведь вы, мистер Бингли, мой должник, — добавила она. — Помните, когда вы уезжали в город прошлой зимой, вы обещали по возвращении приехать к нам на обед. Как видите, я этого не забыла. Признаюсь, я была сильно разочарована, когда вы не вернулись в Хартфордшир, чтобы исполнить свое обещание.</p>
<p>Эти слова вызвали у Бингли некоторое замешательство, и в ответ он пробормотал что-то о задержавших его делах. Следом за тем они уехали.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет очень хотелось пригласить их к обеду в тот же день. Но хотя в Лонгборне всегда был отличный стол, она решила, что потребуется, по крайней мере, удвоить количество блюд, чтобы угодить человеку, с которым она связывала столь большие надежды, а также удовлетворить аппетит и тщеславие его друга, располагавшего десятью тысячами годового дохода.</p>
<p></span><span id="id57"></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XII</p>
</div>
<p>Как только они ушли, Элизабет, чтобы немного успокоить свое волнение, отправилась на прогулку. Ей хотелось без помех поразмыслить над событиями дня, особенно сильно ранившими ее чувства. Больше всего ее удивляло и мучило поведение мистера Дарси.</p>
<p>«Зачем он пришел, — недоумевала она, — если собирался все время просидеть молча, сохраняя на лице это безразличное выражение?»</p>
<p>Ей не удавалось найти объяснение, которое могло бы хоть сколько-нибудь ее порадовать.</p>
<p>«Еще совсем недавно, в Лондоне, он мог быть приветливым и любезным с дядей и тетей. Почему же он не был таким же со мной? Если он со мной чувствует себя неловко, зачем ему было сюда приходить? Если ему больше нет до меня дела, откуда такая замкнутость? Как он меня изводит, этот человек! Не стану о нем больше никогда думать».</p>
<p>Какое-то время ей пришлось поневоле сдерживать свое обещание, так как ее догнала Джейн, счастливый вид которой показывал, что утренний визит доставил ей гораздо больше удовольствия, чем ее сестре.</p>
<p>— Теперь, — сказала она, — когда первая встреча уже позади, у меня на душе стало спокойно. Я уверилась в своих силах, и его приход больше меня не смутит. Мне даже приятно, что он будет обедать у нас во вторник. При этом все смогут убедиться, что между нами нет ничего, кроме обычного знакомства.</p>
<p>— Да, да, разумеется, самого обычного, — с улыбкой ответила Элизабет. — Ах, Джейн, Джейн, будь осторожна!</p>
<p>— Лиззи, дорогая, неужели ты считаешь меня такой слабой, что сколько-нибудь за меня опасаешься?</p>
<p>— Я считаю, что тебе следует опасаться, как бы он не влюбился в тебя еще сильнее.</p>
<p>До вторника молодых людей не видели. И за эти дни в душе миссис Беннет возродились самые счастливые надежды, основанные на радостном виде и любезности мистера Бингли в течение его получасового визита.</p>
<p>Во вторник в Лонгборне собралось большое общество. Двое гостей, которых ждали с особенным нетерпением, как подобает истинным любителям спорта, явились ровно в назначенное время. Когда все направились в столовую, Элизабет с интересом стала наблюдать, займет ли Бингли принадлежавшее ему прежде место около Джейн. Ее предусмотрительная мамаша, волнуемая той же мыслью, не стала усаживать его подле себя. Войдя в комнату, Бингли остановился в некоторой нерешительности. Но Джейн как бы ненароком взглянула по сторонам, как бы ненароком улыбнулась, — и все было решено. Он уселся с ней рядом.</p>
<p>Элизабет с торжеством посмотрела на его друга. Тот отнесся к происшедшему с благородной невозмутимостью. И она могла бы подумать, что Бингли испросил у него разрешения на счастье, если бы не заметила брошенного им на мистера Дарси взгляда, выражавшего шутливое беспокойство.</p>
<p>То, как он вел себя во время обеда по отношению к Джейн, явно доказывало, насколько он ею увлечен. И хотя, по сравнению с прежними встречами, он соблюдал большую осторожность, было ясно, что он и Джейн, если им только не помешают, обретут блаженство в ближайшем будущем. Не осмеливаясь предвосхищать события, Элизабет испытывала удовольствие, наблюдая за поведением Бингли. И это было единственной отрадой, которая отчасти скрашивала ее невеселое настроение. Мистер Дарси сидел рядом с миссис Беннет, удаленный от Элизабет, насколько это было возможно за одним столом. И Элизабет прекрасно понимала, как мало удовольствия каждый из них испытывает от такого соседства и как это должно отражаться на их поведении. Она не могла на таком расстоянии слышать их слов. Но она хорошо видела, как редко они обращались друг к другу и в какой мере эти обращения были сухими и сдержанными. Нелюбезность матери заставила Элизабет еще острее почувствовать, сколь многим они ему обязаны. И иногда она готова была пожертвовать чем угодно ради возможности сказать ему, что хоть кто-то в их семье знает и по-настоящему ценит все доброе, что было им для них сделано.</p>
<p>Она надеялась, что в течение вечера какой-нибудь случай сведет их вместе и этот визит не закончится без ее разговора с мистером Дарси, более обстоятельного, нежели обмен несколькими церемонными приветствиями при встрече. Встревоженная и взволнованная, она сидела в гостиной до прихода мужчин с таким усталым и отсутствующим видом, что могла показаться невежливой. Их появления она ждала с тем чувством, как будто от этой минуты целиком зависело — принесет ли ей сегодняшний вечер хоть какую-то радость.</p>
<p>«Если он не подойдет и на этот раз, — говорила она себе, — я буду знать, что он потерян для меня навсегда».</p>
<p>Мужчины вошли. И судя по виду мистера Дарси, он был склонен ответить ее надеждам. Но увы! Дамы так тесно окружили столик, за которым Джейн разливала чай, а Элизабет — кофе, что поблизости не оказалось ни одного места, где бы он мог присесть. А когда молодые люди оказались неподалеку, одна из девиц прижалась к Элизабет, прошептав:</p>
<p>— Я не желаю, чтобы мужчины нас разлучили! Ведь никто из них нам не нужен, не правда ли?</p>
<p>Дарси отошел в другой конец комнаты. Она проводила его взглядом, завидуя каждому человеку, с которым он вступал в разговор, и боясь, что у нее не хватит терпения угостить кофе всех присутствующих. И вдруг ее возмутила собственная наивность.</p>
<p>«Человек, которому я отказала! Как глупо с моей стороны думать, что он мог снова в меня влюбиться! Разве найдется представитель сильного пола, у которого хватило бы кротости сделать второе предложение? Большего унижения им, наверно, трудно себе представить!»</p>
<p>Ей, однако, стало немного легче, когда он попросил ее налить ему вторую чашку кофе. Воспользовавшись случаем, она спросила:</p>
<p>— Ваша сестра все еще живет в Пемберли?</p>
<p>— Да, она пробудет там до Рождества.</p>
<p>— И с ней никто не остался? Неужели ее покинули все друзья?</p>
<p>— Миссис Энсли еще там. Другие леди три недели назад уехали в Скарборо<a href="#ref1" class="a" onclick="save();">[39]</a>.</p>
<p>Больше она не нашла что сказать. Но если бы ему хотелось поддержать разговор, он мог бы придумать какую-нибудь тему сам. Тем не менее он молча постоял около нее несколько минут и, только когда одна из девиц начала что-то опять нашептывать Элизабет на ухо, отошел в сторону.</p>
<p>Чайная посуда была убрана, карточные столы — раскрыты. Дамы поднялись, и Элизабет надеялась, что он вскоре окажется рядом. Однако и на этот раз ее постигло разочарование: она увидела, как его перехватила миссис Беннет, охотясь на игроков в вист, и усадила против себя. Больше уже она не ждала от вечера ничего. Они должны были просидеть в разных концах комнаты до самого ухода гостей, и теперь ей оставалось только надеяться, что, обращая свой взор слишком часто к ее столику, он окажется таким же незадачливым игроком, как она сама.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет намеревалась удержать мистера Бингли и его друга еще и на ужин. Однако, на ее беду, его экипаж был подан первым, и она не смогла найти способа помешать их отъезду.</p>
<p>— Ну-с, девочки, — сказала она, когда все наконец разъехались, — что вы скажете о сегодняшнем вечере? Все прошло самым отличным образом. Вы заметили, как красиво был убран стол? Оленина совсем не пережарилась — все говорили, что еще не видывали такого сочного окорока. А разве можно было сравнить суп с тем, что мы неделю назад ели у Лукасов? Даже мистер Дарси подтвердил, что куропатки приготовлены превосходно. А он-то, наверно, держит по меньшей мере двух или трех французских поваров. Джейн, милочка, ты еще никогда не выглядела такой красавицей. Миссис Лонг тоже это находит — она прямо так и сказала, отвечая на мой вопрос. И что же, ты думаешь, она при этом добавила? «Ах, миссис Беннет, суждено ей жить в Незерфилде!» Да, да, да, так и сказала! Она такая душка, миссис Лонг, — кто с ней может сравниться? А какие у нее воспитанные племянницы, хоть, правда, и некрасивые. Я просто их обожаю!</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет, короче говоря, находилась в великолепном расположении духа. Она достаточно насмотрелась, как мистер Бингли вел себя по отношению к Джейн, чтобы вполне увериться, что в конце концов он все же станет ее мужем. А поскольку, находясь в хорошем настроении, она ждала, что счастливые события развернутся с умопомрачительной быстротой, она была серьезно разочарована, когда на следующее утро он не явился просить руки ее дочери.</p>
<p>— Какой это был чудесный день! — сказала Джейн, обращаясь к сестре. — И как удачно подобралось все общество — все так подходили друг к другу. Надеюсь, мы и дальше будем встречаться.</p>
<p>Элизабет улыбнулась.</p>
<p>— Почему ты улыбаешься, Лиззи? Тебе не в чем меня подозревать. Мне это неприятно. Поверь мне, я теперь вполне научилась извлекать удовольствие из беседы с ним просто как с приятным и разумным молодым человеком, не испытывая при этом никаких других чувств. И я убедилась, что у него не было ни малейшего желания завоевать мое сердце. Это только могло показаться, потому что, в отличие от других людей, он одарен удивительным обаянием и стремлением радовать всех окружающих.</p>
<p>— Ты поступаешь очень жестоко, — отвечала ее сестра. — Не позволяя мне улыбаться, ты вместе с тем каждую минуту даешь мне для этого повод.</p>
<p>— Иной раз бывает удивительно трудно сделать так, чтобы тебе поверили!</p>
<p>— А бывает — и совсем невозможно!</p>
<p>— Но для чего тебе меня убеждать, что я испытываю нечто большее, чем сама сознаю?</p>
<p>— На этот вопрос я едва ли могу ответить. Мы все любим поучать других, хотя можем им передать лишь то, что, пожалуй, и знать-то не стоит. Прости меня. И если ты настаиваешь на своем безразличии к мистеру Бингли, не делай меня больше своей наперсницей.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XIII</p>
</div>
<p>Через несколько дней после званого обеда мистер Бингли снова навестил Лонгборн, на этот раз без своего друга. Мистер Дарси в это утро уехал в Лондон, с тем, однако, чтобы через десять дней вернуться в Незерфилд. Бингли пробыл более часа, все время находясь в превосходном настроении. Миссис Беннет пригласила его остаться обедать, но, к его великому сожалению, он вынужден был признаться, что уже обещал обедать в другом месте.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, нам повезет больше, когда вы приедете в следующий раз, — сказала миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>Он будет предельно счастлив в любое время, и т.д. и т.п. И если ему позволят сейчас удалиться, он воспользуется первым удобным случаем, чтобы навестить их опять.</p>
<p>— Вы могли бы прийти завтра?</p>
<p>Да, этот день у него ничем не занят. И приглашение было с готовностью принято.</p>
<p>Он пришел, и притом в такое удачное время, когда ни одна из дам еще не завершила своего туалета.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет в одном халате и с наполовину законченной прической вихрем влетела в комнату дочери, крича на ходу:</p>
<p>— Джейн, дорогая, ради бога поторопись! И живо спускайся вниз. Он пришел! Мистер Бингли пришел! Да, да, честное слово. Скорее! Скорее! Вот что, Сара, сию же минуту займись мисс Беннет и помоги ей одеться. Прическа мисс Лиззи может подождать.</p>
<p>— Мы спустимся, как только будем готовы, — сказала Джейн. — Но Китти, я думаю, еще раньше будет внизу, — она поднялась к себе уже полчаса назад.</p>
<p>— Да пропади она, Китти! Ее только не хватало. Вниз, вниз, поживее! Куда девался твой пояс, моя дорогая?</p>
<p>Но когда мать вышла, Джейн решила ни за что не спускаться без одной из своих сестер.</p>
<p>Стремление матери оставить их наедине проявилось столь же сильно и вечером. После чая мистер Беннет, как обычно, удалился в библиотеку, а Мэри поднялась к себе заниматься музыкой. Когда две помехи были таким образом устранены, миссис Беннет принялась подмигивать Элизе и Китти. Ее старания долго оставались незамеченными. Элизабет упорно не обращала на них никакого внимания. Наконец Китти спросила с невинным видом:</p>
<p>— Что такое, маменька? Почему вы подмигиваете? Я что-нибудь должна сделать?</p>
<p>— Ничего, дитя мое, ничего. Тебе просто показалось. После этого она минут пять просидела спокойно. Но, будучи не в силах упустить такую благоприятную возможность, она вдруг вскочила и, сказав Китти: «Пойдем, милочка, со мной, я должна тебе что-то сказать», увела ее из комнаты. Джейн бросила на Элизабет взгляд, говоривший, как неприятны ей эти уловки, и умолявший сестру им не поддаваться.</p>
<p>Через несколько минут миссис Беннет открыла дверь со словами:</p>
<p>— Лиззи, дорогая, мне с тобой нужно поговорить.</p>
<p>— Ты знаешь, мы вполне можем их оставить вдвоем, — сказала мать, как только они оказались за дверью. — Мы с Китти пойдем ко мне в гардеробную комнату.</p>
<p>Элизабет не стала спорить, но задержалась в холле до ухода оттуда матери и Китти, а потом вернулась в гостиную.</p>
<p>На этот раз расчеты миссис Беннет не оправдались. С Бингли все обстояло великолепно, если не считать того, что он еще не стал женихом Джейн. Присущие ему приветливость и непринужденность внесли немалое оживление в их вечернюю беседу. И то, что он терпел назойливую заботу миссис Беннет и без тени неодобрения прощал ей все бестактные замечания, вызывало особую благодарность ее дочери.</p>
<p>Его почти не пришлось уговаривать остаться ужинать. И, прежде чем он покинул дом, было условлено, — главным образом между ним и миссис Беннет, — что он приедет на следующее утро, чтобы поохотиться с мистером Беннетом.</p>
<p>К концу дня Джейн больше не настаивала на том, что она не испытывает к Бингли никаких чувств. В разговоре между сестрами его имя не упоминалось, но Элизабет легла спать со счастливой уверенностью, что дело придет к быстрому завершению, если только мистер Дарси не вернется из Лондона раньше назначенного срока. Говоря серьезно, она, однако, готова была допустить, что все это происходит с его согласия.</p>
<p>Бингли явился точно в условленное время и, как было решено накануне, провел утро с мистером Беннетом. Последний оказался гораздо более приятным партнером, нежели ожидал его спутник. Бингли не был глуп и самонадеян и тем самым не давал мистеру Беннету повода удовлетворить свою склонность к сарказму или замкнуться в презрительном молчании. Благодаря этому он был более общителен и менее причудлив, чем во время их прежних встреч. Разумеется, мистер Бингли вернулся с мистером Беннетом к обеду, а вечером снова была пущена в ход изобретательность миссис Беннет, чтобы оставить его с Джейн наедине. Элизабет, которой нужно было написать письмо, сразу после чая ушла в комнату для завтрака. Остальные собирались играть в карты, и она считала, что при этом нет необходимости противодействовать уловкам мамаши.</p>
<p>Однако, вернувшись в гостиную после того, как письмо было написано, она, к своему изумлению, обнаружила, что в борьбе с этими уловками следовало избегать излишней самоуверенности. Распахнув дверь, она увидела сестру и мистера Бингли стоящих перед камином и углубленных в сосредоточенную беседу. И хотя это обстоятельство само по себе могло и не вызвать подозрений, но выражение их лиц в момент, когда они поспешно обернулись и отошли друг от друга, не позволяло усомниться в происшедшем. Их положение было достаточно неловким. Но ее собственное, казалось бы, было еще более щекотливым. Никто не сказал ни слова, и Элизабет уже намеревалась удалиться, когда Бингли, который перед этим сел по примеру остальных на диван, вдруг вскочил и, прошептав что-то ее сестре, вышел из комнаты.</p>
<p>Джейн ничего не могла скрывать от Элизабет в тех случаях, когда откровенности сопутствовали радостные переживания. Крайне взволнованная, она бросилась к ней на шею и призналась, что считает себя счастливейшим существом на земле.</p>
<p>— Этого для меня слишком много! — добавила она. — Право, слишком. Я ничего подобного не заслужила. Почему все другие не могут быть так же счастливы?!</p>
<p>Поздравления ее сестры были принесены с таким жаром, искренностью и восторгом, которые едва ли можно передать словами. Каждая ее фраза шла от самого сердца и была для Джейн новым источником блаженства. Но Джейн не могла себе позволить долго оставаться с Элизабет, чтобы высказать ей все, что она в эти минуты переживала.</p>
<p>— Нужно сейчас же подняться к маме, — воскликнула она. — Нельзя забывать ни на минуту, как нежно она обо мне заботилась. Мне бы не хотелось, чтобы она узнала об этом от кого-то другого. Он уже пошел к папе. Ах, Лиззи, подумать только, сколько радости мои слова принесут нашей семье! Как мне пережить столько счастья?!</p>
<p>И она помчалась к матери, которая перед тем умышленно прекратила игру в карты и теперь сидела наверху с Китти.</p>
<p>Оставшаяся в одиночестве Элизабет улыбалась, думая о том, как просто и легко в конце концов разрешились все трудности, волновавшие и мучившие их в течение стольких месяцев.</p>
<p>— И вот к чему привели, — сказала она, — все каверзы и уловки его сестер, вся осторожность и осмотрительность его друга! Самый благополучный, самый мудрый и самый естественный конец!</p>
<p>Через несколько минут вернулся Бингли, краткая беседа которого с их отцом увенчалась полным успехом.</p>
<p>— Где же мисс Беннет? — спросил он, входя в гостиную.</p>
<p>— Она наверху у мамы. Наверно, она скоро вернется. Прикрыв дверь за собой и подойдя ближе, он попросил Элизабет, чтобы она пожелала им счастья, а ему подарила свою сестринскую привязанность. Элизабет искренне и от всей души выразила ему свою радость по поводу того, что им предстоит породниться, и они сердечно пожали друг другу руки. После этого, до самого прихода Джейн, ей пришлось выслушивать все, что ему было необходимо сказать о своем блаженстве и о достоинствах ее сестры. И хотя это были слова влюбленного, Элизабет была готова поверить, что его мечты сбудутся и что им предстоит счастливая жизнь, залогом которой были здравый смысл и чудесный характер Джейн, а также общность их вкусов и чувств.</p>
<p>Все в этот вечер были настроены необыкновенно радостно. Ощущение удовлетворенности и спокойствия придавало такое приятное оживление лицу Джейн, что она выглядела еще более красивой, чем обычно. Китти хихикала и улыбалась, мечтая о том, чтобы поскорее наступила и ее очередь. Миссис Беннет, выражая свое согласие на этот брак и высказывая свое одобрение, была не способна облечь свои чувства в слова, хотя говорила с Бингли только об этом в течение получаса. А когда мистер Беннет во время ужина присоединился ко всем, его вид и поведение свидетельствовали, насколько и он доволен происшедшим событием. Однако до самого ухода гостя он не промолвил по этому поводу ни слова. Только когда с наступлением ночи Бингли уехал, отец, обернувшись к дочери, произнес:</p>
<p>— Поздравляю тебя, Джейн. Ты будешь счастлива.</p>
<p>Джейн, подбежав к нему, поцеловала и поблагодарила отца за его доброту.</p>
<p>— Ты славная девочка, — сказал он, — и меня радует, что твоя жизнь сложится хорошо. Я не сомневаюсь, что вы отлично подходите друг к другу. В вас много общего. Оба вы настолько уступчивы, что между вами не может возникнуть разногласий; настолько доверчивы, что вас обведет вокруг пальца любая служанка; и настолько щедры, что вам всегда будет не хватать ваших доходов.</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, этого не случится. Неблагоразумие и легкомыслие в денежных делах с моей стороны были бы непростительными.</p>
<p>— Не хватит доходов? Но, дорогой мистер Беннет, — воскликнула его жена, — о чем вы толкуете? Он же получает четыре или пять тысяч в год, — может быть, даже больше! — И, обратившись к дочери, она продолжала: — Джейн, дорогая, любимая! Я просто в восторге! Боже, меня ждет бессонная ночь! Я знала, что так случится, — разве все могло кончиться иначе? Недаром же ты такая красавица! Когда год назад, помню, я вас увидела вместе в Хартфордшире, меня осенило: вот настоящая пара! Это самый очаровательный молодой человек, которого мне только приходилось встречать!</p>
<p>Уикхем, Лидия были забыты. Джейн, бесспорно, стала ее любимой дочерью. В эту минуту она ни о ком больше не думала. Между тем младшие сестры уже начали смотреть на Джейн, как на источник возможных радостей в будущем. Мэри просила разрешения пользоваться незерфилдской библиотекой, а Китти умоляла, чтобы зимой в Незерфилде почаще давались балы.</p>
<p>С этого времени Бингли, естественно, сделался в Лонгборне ежедневным гостем. Он появлялся перед завтраком и уходил после ужина, если только какой-нибудь варвар-сосед — разумеется заслуживавший самой жестокой кары — не присылал ему приглашения на обед, от которого он не мог отказаться.</p>
<p>Элизабет теперь не часто удавалось поговорить с Джейн, так как, пока Бингли находился в Лонгборне, последняя не могла уделять внимание кому-то другому. Однако она была полезна каждому из влюбленных в часы вынужденной разлуки. В отсутствие Джейн Бингли всегда доставлял себе удовольствие, разговаривая о ней с ее сестрой. А Джейн, когда не было Бингли, стремилась к подобному же утешению.</p>
<p>— Я была счастлива, — сказала она однажды вечером, — когда узнала, что ему не было известно о моем приезде в Лондон прошлой весной. Мне такая мысль не приходила в голову.</p>
<p>— А мне приходила, — ответила Элизабет. — Но как же, по его мнению, это могло случиться?</p>
<p>— Все объясняется чувствами его сестер. Они не одобряли его знакомства со мной. И тут нет ничего удивительного, если подумать, как легко он мог сделать выбор, более удачный во всех отношениях. Но как только они увидят, — а я верю, что они это в самом деле увидят, — насколько он счастлив со мной, они примирятся с его женитьбой, и наши отношения снова станут хорошими. Правда, мы уже, конечно, не будем друг для друга тем, чем были когда-то.</p>
<p>— Это самая суровая обвинительная речь, — сказала Элизабет, — которую я от тебя слышала. Добрая девочка! Мне, право, будет досадно, если я увижу, что ты снова станешь предметом фальшивой привязанности мисс Бингли.</p>
<p>— Ты только подумай, Лиззи, когда он в прошлом году уехал в Лондон, оказывается, он уже был сильно в меня влюблен. И если бы только не его уверенность в моем равнодушии, он бы непременно вернулся.</p>
<p>— Он в самом деле допустил большую ошибку, но она делает честь его скромности.</p>
<p>Это, естественно, вызвало со стороны Джейн целый панегирик деликатности Бингли и присущей ему недооценке собственных качеств.</p>
<p>Элизабет была рада узнать, что Бингли не рассказал ей про вмешательство друга, так как это могло бы, несмотря на величайшее великодушие и незлобивость сестры, все же бросить тень на ее отношение к Дарси.</p>
<p>— Я, несомненно, самое счастливое существо на земле! — воскликнула Джейн. — Лиззи, почему в нашей семье мне одной так повезло? Как бы мне хотелось, чтобы ты ощущала то же самое! Если бы только нашелся другой подобный человек для тебя!</p>
<p>— Даже если бы ты мне предложила их сотню, я все же не могла бы стать такой же счастливой. Пока у меня не будет твоего характера и твоей доброты, не видать мне и твоего блаженства. Нет, нет, дай мне идти своим путем. И, быть может, если мне очень повезет, мне еще подвернется со временем второй мистер Коллинз.</p>
<p>Событие в Лонгборне не могло долго сохраняться в секрете. Миссис Беннет позволила себе шепнуть о нем на ухо миссис Филипс, а та уже без всяких предосторожностей рассказала об этом всем меритонским знакомьм.</p>
<p>Беннетов без промедления провозгласили самым удачливым семейством на свете, хотя всего несколько недель тому назад — сразу после побега Лидии — их злополучная фамилия была всеми вычеркнута из списка знакомых.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="id59"></span></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XIV</p>
</div>
<p>Однажды утром, спустя неделю после обручения Джейн, когда мистер Бингли и дамы семейства Беннет находились в комнате для завтрака, внимание всех привлек шум экипажа. За окном они увидели проехавшую по газону карету, запряженную четверкой лошадей. Для визитов было еще слишком рано, да и прибывший экипаж не принадлежал ни одному из соседей. Лошади были почтовыми, а карета и ливреи сопровождавшей ее прислуги — никому не знакомы.</p>
<p>Однако было очевидно, что кто-то все же приехал, и Бингли тотчас уговорил Джейн отправиться на прогулку, чтобы избавиться от участия в скучной церемонии приема гостей. Парочка удалилась, а оставшиеся тщетно высказывали догадки о том, кто бы это мог к ним пожаловать, когда дверь распахнулась и в комнату вошла леди Кэтрин де Бёр.</p>
<p>Все, разумеется, предвкушали нечто необычное, но то изумление, которое они на самом деле испытали, превзошло ожидания. И хотя миссис Беннет и Китти совсем не были с ней знакомы, даже они не были удивлены этим визитом так сильно, как Элизабет.</p>
<p>Войдя в комнату с более, чем всегда, бесцеремонным видом, леди Кэтрин ничем, кроме легкого кивка, не ответила на приветствие Элизабет и, не говоря ни слова, уселась в кресло. Элизабет назвала матери имя ее светлости, хотя последняя даже не попросила ее представить.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет, будучи крайне польщена посещением столь высокой особы, старалась быть с ней крайне любезной. Просидев некоторое время в молчании, леди Кэтрин сухо спросила Элизабет:</p>
<p>— Надеюсь, мисс Беннет, у вас все в порядке. Эта дама, я полагаю, ваша мать?</p>
<p>Элизабет ответила утвердительно.</p>
<p>— А это, должно быть, одна из ваших сестер?</p>
<p>— О да, сударыня, — вмешалась миссис Беннет, радуясь возможности поговорить с леди Кэтрин. — Это моя предпоследняя дочь. Самая младшая у меня на днях вышла замуж. А старшая гуляет где-то в саду с молодым человеком, который, надеюсь, скоро станет членом нашей семьи.</p>
<p>— У вас совсем маленький парк, — сказала леди Кэтрин после короткого молчания.</p>
<p>— Смею заметить, миледи, что хоть его, разумеется, не сравнишь с Розингсом, он все же гораздо больше, чем у сэра Уильямса Лукаса.</p>
<p>— В этой комнате нельзя проводить летние вечера. Окна выходят на запад.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет заверила ее, что комнатой в послеобеденное время не пользуются, и затем сказала:</p>
<p>— Могу я осведомиться у вашей светлости, как здоровье мистера и миссис Коллинз?</p>
<p>— В полном порядке. Я видела их позавчера вечером.</p>
<p>Элизабет предполагала, что теперь на свет будет извлечено письмо, которое ей прислала Шарлотта, так как это могло быть единственной причиной подобного визита. Письмо, однако, не появилось, и она почувствовала себя окончательно озадаченной.</p>
<p>Миссис Беннет любезнейшим образом предложила ее светлости немножко подкрепиться, но леди Кэтрин решительно, хотя и не слишком учтиво, отказалась. Затем, поднявшись, она сказала, обращаясь к Элизабет:</p>
<p>— Мисс Беннет, там за газоном у вас, кажется, довольно живописные заросли. Я хотела бы их осмотреть, если вы составите мне компанию.</p>
<p>— Ступай, дорогая, — воскликнула ее мать, — и проведи ее светлость по разным тропинкам. Надеюсь, вы останетесь довольны уединением.</p>
<p>Элизабет подчинилась. Сбегав к себе в комнату за зонтиком, она провела знатную гостью по лестнице. Проходя через холл, леди Кэтрин открыла двери в столовую и гостиную и, признав их после краткого осмотра довольно приличными, вышла из дома.</p>
<p>У подъезда продолжала стоять карета, внутри которой Элизабет увидела знакомую камеристку ее светлости. В полном молчании они шли по гравиевой дорожке, которая вела к зарослям. Элизабет твердо решила не начинать разговора с посетительницей, поведение которой казалось более, чем обычно, высокомерным и вызывающим.</p>
<p>«Что я могла находить в ней общего с ее племянником?» — думала она, всматриваясь в лицо спутницы.</p>
<p>Как только они вошли в заросли, леди Кэтрин приступила к разговору.</p>
<p>— Вы не можете недоумевать по поводу причины моего приезда. Причину должны были вам подсказать сердце и совесть.</p>
<p>Элизабет посмотрела на нее с искренним изумлением.</p>
<p>— Вы ошибаетесь, сударыня. Мне совершенно непонятно, чему я обязана этой честью.</p>
<p>— Мисс Беннет, — продолжала ее светлость суровым тоном, — вам следовало бы знать, что я не позволяю с собой шутить. Если вы вздумали быть неискренней, <em>меня</em> на этот путь вы завлечь не сможете. Мой характер всегда славился откровенностью и прямотой, а в подобном деле я от них и подавно не отступлюсь. Два дня назад до меня дошло известие, которое меня крайне возмутило. Мне было сообщено, что не только ваша сестра готовится выгодно выйти замуж, но что и вы, мисс Элизабет, по-видимому, надеетесь вскоре сочетаться узами брака с моим племянником, моим <em>собственным</em> племянником, мистером Дарси. Конечно, я <em>понимаю,</em> насколько это гнусная выдумка. И хотя я не унижу моего племянника даже предположением, что это может случиться, я все же решила незамедлительно приехать сюда, чтобы вы сами могли узнать от меня, как я к этому отношусь.</p>
<p>— Но если вы были убеждены в неправдоподобности такого известия, — сказала Элизабет, покраснев от удивления и досады, — мне непонятно, зачем вы взяли на себя труд ехать в такую даль. Чего вы, ваша светлость, хотели добиться?</p>
<p>— Чтобы вы тут же полностью это известие опровергли.</p>
<p>— Если подобный слух в самом деле распространился, — холодно заметила Элизабет, — ваш приезд в Лонгборн и встреча со мной и моей семьей скорее послужит его подтверждением.</p>
<p>— Вы, кажется, сказали «если»?! Вы что же, хотите прикинуться, что вам о нем ничего не известно? Разве это не вы сами ухитрились его пустить? И вы же не знаете о его существовании?</p>
<p>— До меня ничего подобного не доходило.</p>
<p>— Вы можете подтвердить, что для него нет <em>никаких</em> оснований?</p>
<p>— Я отнюдь не притязаю на ту искренность, которая свойственна вашей светлости. Вы способны задавать мне вопросы, на которые я предпочитаю не отвечать.</p>
<p>— Я этого не потерплю! Мисс Беннет, я требую, чтобы вы дали мне исчерпывающие объяснения. Правда ли он — в самом ли деле мой племянник сделал вам предложение?</p>
<p>— Ваша светлость сочла это невозможным.</p>
<p>— Это должно было быть невозможным, этого не могло случиться, если только ему не изменил рассудок. Но вы могли попытаться его завлечь и заставить уловками и соблазнами забыть в ослеплении свой долг перед собой и своей семьей. Вы могли заманить его в сеть.</p>
<p>— Если бы я так поступила, от меня труднее всего было бы добиться признания в этом поступке.</p>
<p>— Вы понимаете, мисс Беннет, с кем вы имеете дело? Я не привыкла, чтобы со мной так разговаривали. Будучи чуть ли не самой близкой его родственницей, я вправе знать, что таится в его душе.</p>
<p>— Но вы не вправе знать, что таится в <em>моей.</em> А ваше поведение тем более не может склонить меня к откровенности.</p>
<p>— Я хотела бы, чтобы вы правильно меня поняли. Подобному браку, о котором вы имели дерзость мечтать, не суждено состояться. Да, да, не суждено. Мистер Дарси обручен с моей дочерью. Ну-с, что вы теперь мне скажете?</p>
<p>— Только одно. Если это действительно так, вы не могли бы предположить, что он просил моей руки.</p>
<p>Леди Кэтрин минуту поколебалась, но потом сказала:</p>
<p>— Они обручены несколько необычным образом. С раннего детства они предназначались друг для друга. Это было заветным желанием их матерей. Союз был скреплен в ту пору, когда наши дети еще покоились в колыбелях. И теперь, когда материнская воля должна была осуществиться в их браке, поперек дороги встала женщина низкого происхождения, без положения в свете и ничем не связанная с нашим семейством! Разве для вас ничего не значит воля его родных? Разве его молчаливое обязательство перед мисс де Бёр для вас ничто? Неужели вы полностью лишены всякого чувства порядочности и деликатности? И разве вы не слышали от меня, что с первых же дней жизни он предназначался в супруги своей кузине?</p>
<p>— О да, я слыхала об этом прежде. Но разве меня это касается? Если бы моему вступлению в брак с вашим племянником мешало только такое обстоятельство, — разумеется, сознание, что его мать и тетка хотели женить его на мисс де Бёр, не могло бы меня остановить. Обе вы сделали, что могли, задумывая его женитьбу. Осуществить ее дано другим. Если мистер Дарси ни словом, ни чувством не связан с вашей дочерью, почему он не вправе остановить свой выбор на другой женщине? И если бы его выбор пал на меня, почему я не могла бы принять его руки?</p>
<p>— Потому что честь, приличие, благоразумие, наконец, собственная ваша выгода запрещают вам это сделать! О да, мисс Беннет, именно выгода. Ибо не ждите какого бы то ни было внимания к себе со стороны его семьи и друзей. Вы будете осуждены, отвергнуты и заклеймены презрением каждого близкого ему человека. Союз с вами будет считаться позором. Никто из нас даже не вспомнит вашего имени.</p>
<p>— Что ж, потеря и вправду велика, — отвечала Элизабет. — Но супруга мистера Дарси будет располагать такими необыкновенными источниками радости, присущими ее положению, что в конечном счете ей не придется особенно печалиться.</p>
<p>— Упрямая, вздорная девчонка! Мне стыдно за вас. Вот какова благодарность за внимание, которым я удостоила вас прошлой весной?! По-вашему, вы мне за это ничем не обязаны? Ну-ка, присядем. Извольте понять, мисс Беннет, я прибыла сюда с твердым намерением добиться того, что задумала. Ничто не сможет мне помешать! Мне еще не приходилось потакать чьим-либо капризам. И я не имею привычки уступать.</p>
<p>— Это усугубляет затруднительность положения вашей светлости. Но меня это не касается.</p>
<p>— Я не позволю, чтобы меня прерывали! Выслушайте меня молча. Моя дочь и мой племянник созданы друг для друга. По материнской линии оба они происходят от единого знатного рода. Отцы их принадлежат к уважаемым, благородным и древним, хоть и не титулованным, семьям. Обе стороны располагают прекрасными состояниями. Они предназначены друг для друга в глазах каждого представителя того и другого дома. И что же встает между ними? Притязания выскочки, молодой женщины без средств, без связей. Разве подобное допустимо? Нет, этого не должно быть, и этого не будет. Если бы вы были способны понять, в чем состоит ваша собственная выгода, вы бы сами не пожелали покинуть тот круг, в котором росли.</p>
<p>— Но, выходя замуж за вашего племянника, я, по-моему, вовсе не покидаю этого круга. Он дворянин. Я дочь дворянина. Мы в этом смысле равны.</p>
<p>— Ну что же, вы дочь дворянина, допустим. Но из какой семьи ваша мать? Кто ваши дяди и тетки? Не воображаете ли вы, что мне неизвестно, чем они занимаются?</p>
<p>— Кем бы ни были мои родственники, — сказала Элизабет, — если против них ничего не имеет мистер Дарси, это не должно беспокоить и вас.</p>
<p>— Скажите без обиняков, вы обручены?</p>
<p>Элизабет не стала бы отвечать на этот вопрос, чтобы ублажить леди Кэтрин. Однако, после короткого раздумья, она не могла не сказать:</p>
<p>— Нет, не обручена.</p>
<p>Леди Кэтрин, казалось, была довольна.</p>
<p>— И вы даете мне слово никогда с ним не обручаться?</p>
<p>— Подобного обещания я не дам.</p>
<p>— Мисс Беннет, я поражена и возмущена! Я считала вас более разумной девицей. Но не обманывайте себя ложной надеждой, будто я могу пойти на уступки. Я не уеду, пока вы не дадите требуемых мной заверений.</p>
<p>— А я ни за что их не дам. Меня нельзя запугать, толкнув на подобную нелепость. Вы, ваша светлость, желаете, чтобы мистер Дарси женился на вашей дочери? Но если бы я дала требуемое обещание, разве брак между ними стал более вероятным? Разве при его склонности ко мне я могла бы, отвергнув его руку и сердце, побудить мистера Дарси сделать предложение его кузине? Позвольте, леди Кэтрин, сказать, что доводы, которыми вы подкрепляете ваше из ряда вон выходящее требование, настолько же легковесны, насколько само оно безрассудно. Вы, видимо, совершенно не разобрались в моем характере, если могли предположить, что на меня подействуют подобные рассуждения. Мне неизвестно, в какой мере ваш племянник одобряет ваше вмешательство в его дела. Но у вас, во всяком случае, нет никакого права вмешиваться в мои. А потому я вынуждена просить вас избавить меня от дальнейших посягательств такого рода.</p>
<p>— Ну, ну, не так скоро, если позволите. Я ведь еще не кончила. Ко всему сказанному я вынуждена добавить еще одно обстоятельство. Для меня не является тайной позорный побег вашей младшей сестры. Я знаю о нем решительно все. В том числе, что женитьба на ней молодого человека была кое-как состряпана задним числом на средства папаши и дядюшки. И что же, подобной особе суждено стать сестрой моего племянника? А ее мужу, сыну управляющего его покойного отца, — его братом? Небо и ад! О чем вы думаете? Неужто сень Пемберли может подвергнуться подобному осквернению?!</p>
<p>— Больше вы уже ничего не сможете мне сказать, — гневно ответила Элизабет. — Вы оскорбили меня <em>всеми</em> возможными способами. С вашего позволения, я возвращаюсь в дом.</p>
<p>При этих словах она встала. Леди Кэтрин также поднялась, и они пошли обратно. Ее светлость была в ярости.</p>
<p>— Значит, вам дела нет до чести и репутации моего племянника? Эгоистичная, бесчувственная девчонка! Неужели вы не понимаете, что, связав себя с вами, он опозорит себя перед всем светом?</p>
<p>— Леди Кэтрин, мне больше нечего вам сказать. Мои чувства вам известны.</p>
<p>— И вы, стало быть, решили его заманить?</p>
<p>— Я не говорила подобных вещей. Я решила лишь поступать сообразно собственному представлению о своем счастье и не считаясь при этом ни с вами, ни с какой-либо другой, столь же далекой мне персоной.</p>
<p>— Ну что же, отлично. Итак, вы отказались выполнить мою просьбу. Вы решили погубить его в глазах друзей и вызвать к нему презрение всего света.</p>
<p>— Ни долг, ни честь, ни благодарность, — ответила Элизабет, — ни к чему меня сейчас не обязывают. Мой брак с мистером Дарси не нарушил бы никаких заповедей. А что касается чувств его родни и презрения всего света, то меня бы едва ли особенно огорчило, если бы наш брак вызвал у его родных известное беспокойство, тогда как весь свет достаточно разумен, чтобы не отнестись к этому столь серьезно.</p>
<p>— Так вот ваш действительный образ мыслей?! И это ваше последнее слово? Прекрасно. Теперь я знаю, как мне поступить. Не воображайте же, мисс Беннет, что ваши притязания увенчаются успехом. Я приехала, чтобы вас испытать. Мне казалось, что у вас больше здравого смысла. Но будьте уверены, я добьюсь своей цели.</p>
<p>Леди Кэтрин продолжала говорить в том же духе, пока они не подошли к ее карете. Быстро обернувшись, она произнесла:</p>
<p>— Я не приму ваших прощальных приветствий, мисс Беннет. И вовсе не прошу передать от меня привет вашей матери. Вы не заслуживаете подобных знаков внимания. Я возмущена до глубины души.</p>
<p>Элизабет ничего не ответила и, не пытаясь пригласить ее светлость вернуться в дом, преспокойно вошла в него сама. Поднимаясь по ступенькам, она услышала шум отъезжавшей кареты. В холле ее с нетерпением встретила миссис Беннет, которой хотелось знать, почему леди Кэтрин не зашла, чтобы немного отдохнуть.</p>
<p>— Она предпочла сразу уехать, — ответила ее дочь.</p>
<p>— Ее светлость показалась мне очень приятной дамой! И ее визит к нам — необыкновенная любезность! Ведь, насколько я поняла, она заехала сюда лишь для того, чтобы сообщить нам о здоровье Коллинзов. Должно быть, она куда-то направлялась и, проезжая Меритон, подумала, что ей следует тебя навестить. Надеюсь, у нее не было к тебе никаких особых дел, Лиззи?</p>
<p>Элизабет пришлось здесь несколько покривить душой, настолько немыслимо было попытаться передать матери содержание их беседы.</p>
<p></span><span id="id60"></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XV</p>
</div>
<p>Волнение, вызванное этим необыкновенным визитом, было нелегко успокоить. В течение многих часов Элизабет была совершенно не в силах думать о чем-то другом. Итак, леди Кэтрин в самом деле пустилась в путешествие из Розингса с единственной целью расстроить ее предполагаемую помолвку с мистером Дарси! Другого разумного объяснения этой поездки не существовало. Элизабет, однако, была не в состоянии понять, как мог возникнуть слух об их помолвке. И, наконец, ей пришло в голову, что в то время, когда ожидание одной свадьбы заставляло всех угадывать следующую, дружба между Дарси и Бингли и ее близость с Джейн могли послужить достаточным основанием для подобного слуха. Она и сама иногда подумывала, что замужество сестры сделает ее встречи с Дарси более частыми. А их соседи из Лукас Лоджа (из переписки которых с Коллинзами леди Кэтрин, очевидно, почерпнула эти сведения) могли считать решенным то, что ей казалось возможным в далеком будущем.</p>
<p>Перебирая в памяти слова леди Кэтрин, она, однако, не могла избавиться от беспокойства по поводу возможных последствий ее вмешательства. Фраза о том, что она непременно помешает их браку, заставляла думать, что она собирается воздействовать на племянника. И Элизабет боялась себе представить, как он отнесется к перечислению всех зол, которые повлекла бы за собой эта женитьба. Она не знала, насколько сильна его привязанность к тетке и в какой мере леди Кэтрин влияет на его образ мыслей, но легко было предположить, что Дарси придерживается более высокого мнения о ее светлости, чем Элизабет. И казалось несомненным, что, перечисляя все отрицательные стороны женитьбы на девушке столь низкого круга по сравнению с его собственным, тетка затронет в нем самое уязвимое место. Ему, с его понятиями о семейной гордости, доводы, выглядевшие для Элизабет вздорными и неубедительными, вполне могли представляться разумными и заслуживающими внимания.</p>
<p>Если он до того колебался, — а ей часто казалось, что это именно так, — то совет и настояния близкой родственницы могли укрепить его решимость. И тогда он позволит себе быть счастливым лишь настолько, насколько это совместно с достоинством его семьи. В этом случае он уже больше сюда не приедет. Леди Кэтрин может встретиться с ним, проезжая через Лондон, и он будет вынужден отказаться от обещания вернуться в Незерфилд, которое он дал Бингли.</p>
<p>— Итак, — решила Элизабет, — если в ближайшие дни он извинится перед другом в невозможности выполнить данное ему слово, мне будет ясно, с чем это связано. И я выброшу из головы всякую надежду на его постоянство. Если руку и сердце, которые я готова ему отдать, могут заменить этому человеку сожаления о нашей разлуке, он не стоит того, чтобы я пожалела о нем.</p>
<p>Остальные члены семьи, узнав, кто их посетил, были крайне удивлены. Однако они удовлетворились тем же объяснением, которое успокоило миссис Беннет. Элизабет была, таким образом, избавлена от весьма неприятных разговоров.</p>
<p>На следующее утро, спускаясь по лестнице, она встретила мистера Беннета, который вышел из библиотеки, держа какое-то письмо.</p>
<p>— Лиззи, — сказал он, — ты как раз мне нужна. Зайди, пожалуйста, ко мне.</p>
<p>Элизабет последовала за отцом, недоумевая, что бы такое он хотел ей сказать. Она догадывалась, что это могло быть связано с полученным письмом. Внезапно ей пришло в голову, что письмо написано леди Кэтрин. И она с ужасом представила себе неизбежное в этом случае объяснение.</p>
<p>Они сели перед камином, и мистер Беннет сказал:</p>
<p>— Я получил утром письмо, которое меня чрезвычайно удивило. Поскольку оно касается тебя, тебе следует знать его содержание. Я и не предполагал, что еще одна моя дочь находится на пороге замужества. Позволь мне поздравить тебя с выдающейся победой.</p>
<p>Щеки Элизабет вспыхнули, когда она вдруг подумала, что письмо это написано не теткой, а племянником. И она не могла определить, какое чувство в ее душе окажется при этом сильнее: радость ли по поводу его сватовства или досада из-за того, что он не обратился к ней самой. Мистер Беннет между тем продолжал:</p>
<p>— Ты у меня большая умница. А молодые девицы вообще удивительно проницательны в подобных делах. Но боюсь, даже твоей смекалки недостаточно, чтобы отгадать имя поклонника. Это письмо от мистера Коллинза.</p>
<p>— Мистера Коллинза? Что же он мог написать?</p>
<p>— Самые дельные вещи, разумеется. Начинает он с поздравлений по поводу предстоящего бракосочетания Джейн. Об этом он, по-видимому, извещен кем-нибудь из милейших сплетничающих Лукасов. Я не стану испытывать твое терпение, перечитывая, что он говорит по этому поводу. Тебя касаются следующие строки:</p>
<p>«…Выразив Вам, таким образом, искренние поздравления миссис Коллинз и мои собственные по поводу этого радостного события, мне бы хотелось с Вашего разрешения весьма осторожно намекнуть Вам и на другое обстоятельство, о котором мы осведомлены из того же источника. Предполагается, что Ваша дочь Элизабет будет носить фамилию Беннет немногим дольше, чем ее старшая сестра, и что избранный ею спутник жизни вполне обоснованно может считаться одной из наиболее выдающихся личностей этой страны».</p>
<p>— Ну-ка, Лиззи, попробуй догадаться, кто бы это мог быть?</p>
<p>«Этого молодого дворянина небо особенно щедро наделило всем, чего только может пожелать смертный: благородным происхождением, богатством и властью над человеческими судьбами. И все же, невзирая на эти его достоинства, мне бы хотелось предостеречь мою кузину Элизабет, а также и Вас в отношении печальных последствий, связанных с излишне поспешным ответом на его предложение, очевидная привлекательность которого могла бы заставить Вас сразу его принять».</p>
<p>— Ну как, Лиззи, ты еще не смекнула, что это за дворянин? Погоди, сейчас выяснится.</p>
<p>«Предостерегая Вас, я руководствуюсь следующими соображениями: у нас есть все основания предполагать, что тетка этого дворянина, леди Кэтрин де Бёр, посмотрела бы на этот брак крайне неодобрительно».</p>
<p>— Мистер Дарси — вот это кто! Что ж, Лиззи, славно я тебя озадачил? Скажи, пожалуйста, мог ли он с Лукасами отыскать среди наших знакомых какого-нибудь другого человека, имя которого так явно разоблачало бы лживость их болтовни? Умудриться выбрать мистера Дарси, которому достаточно посмотреть на любую женщину, чтобы сразу увидеть все ее недостатки, и который, возможно, вообще ни разу на тебя не взглянул! Это великолепно!</p>
<p>Элизабет попыталась сделать вид, что ей тоже необычайно весело. Но она могла изобразить на лице только весьма натянутую улыбку. Еще никогда до сих пор отец не упражнялся в остроумии столь неприятным для нее образом.</p>
<p>— Ну, как, здорово это тебя насмешило?</p>
<p>— Да, конечно. Но читайте, пожалуйста, дальше.</p>
<p>— «Когда вчера вечером я упомянул ее светлости о возможности подобного брака, она тотчас же со свойственной ей снисходительностью весьма прямо выразила свои чувства по этому поводу, дав понять, что, ввиду некоторых неблагоприятных родственных связей моей кузины, она ни за что бы не согласилась на этот, по ее словам, столь недостойный союз. Я счел своим долгом как можно скорее оповестить об этом мою кузину, дабы она и ее благородный поклонник были осведомлены о том, что их ожидает, и не спешили сочетаться браком, который не получит должного благословения». Ко всему этому мистер Коллинз добавляет: «Я искренне обрадовался, узнав, что достойный сожаления поступок моей кузины Лидии удалось так благополучно замять, и печалюсь лишь о том, что сведения об их совместной жизни до свадьбы приобрели столь широкую огласку. Однако мне не подобает пренебрегать обязанностями, присущими моему сану. И я не могу не выразить моего недоумения в связи с известием о приеме, который Вы оказали молодой чете в своем доме сразу после их бракосочетания. Увы, этот шаг был не чем иным, как поощрением порока. И если бы Лонгборн находился в моем приходе, я не преминул бы воспрепятствовать этому весьма решительно. Вам, разумеется, следовало простить их как христианину. Но они вовеки не должны были являться Вашему взору, а их имена никогда не должны были тревожить Ваш слух».</p>
<p>— Вот, оказывается, как он представляет себе христианское всепрощение! Остальная часть письма посвящена делам его дорогой Шарлотты и ожидаемому им появлению юной оливковой ветви. Но, Лиззи, у тебя почему-то такой вид, как будто все это не доставило тебе удовольствия. Надеюсь, ты не собираешься превращаться в недотрогу и строить оскорбленную мину по поводу всякой дурацкой болтовни? Разве мы не живем лишь для того, чтобы давать повод для развлечения нашим соседям и, в свой черед, смеяться над ними?</p>
<p>— О нет, — воскликнула Элизабет, — меня письмо очень рассмешило. Но это так странно!</p>
<p>— Еще бы, вся прелесть в том и заключается. Если бы они выбрали кого-нибудь другого, было бы не так интересно. Но его равнодушие к тебе и твоя неприязнь к нему превращают это в изумительную нелепость! Ты знаешь, как я не люблю писать письма. И все же я ни за что не перестану переписываться с Коллинзом! Когда я читаю его послания, я поневоле отдаю ему предпочтение даже перед Уикхемом, сколь бы я ни ценил бесстыдство и лицемерие моего дорогого зятя. Кстати, Лиззи, что сказала леди Кэтрин по поводу этого сообщения? Уж не приехала ли она для того, чтобы лишить тебя своего благословения?</p>
<p>В ответ на этот вопрос Элизабет только рассмеялась. И так как мистер Беннет задал его без всякой задней мысли, он больше ее не мучил дальнейшими расспросами. Еще никогда Элизабет не приходилось с таким трудом изображать чувства, которых она не испытывала. От нее требовали, чтобы она смеялась, когда ей хотелось плакать. Особенно жестоко ранил ее отец словами о безразличии мистера Дарси. И она никак не могла решить: то ли ей дивиться его недостаточной наблюдательности, то ли опасаться, что не отец на самом деле видит слишком мало, а она — слишком много.</p>
<p></span></span></p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XVI</p>
</div>
<p>Вскоре после визита леди Кэтрин мистер Бингли, вместо ожидаемого Элизабет письма с извинениями от своего друга, привез в Лонгборн мистера Дарси собственной персоной. Молодые люди приехали рано, и, прежде чем миссис Беннет успела сообщить мистеру Дарси, что они имели честь принимать у себя его тетку (чего с трепетом ожидала ее дочь), мистер Бингли, жаждавший поскорее остаться с Джейн наедине, предложил всем отправиться на прогулку. Это предложение было одобрено. Миссис Беннет не имела обыкновения гулять, у Мэри никогда не было свободного времени, но пятеро остальных тотчас же вышли из дома. Бингли и Джейн, впрочем, охотно позволили себя обогнать. Они постепенно все больше отставали, и Элизабет, Китти и Дарси должны были развлекать друг друга как умели. Впрочем, все трое говорили очень немного. Китти лишилась языка, потому что робела перед Дарси, Элизабет набиралась решимости перед неким отчаянным шагом, а он, возможно, был занят тем же.</p>
<p>Они шли в направлении Лукас Лоджа, где Китти собиралась повидать Марию. И так как разлука с Китти не могла, по мнению Элизабет, служить основанием для общего беспокойства, они смело отправились дальше вдвоем. Наступила минута, когда она должна была проявить смелость, и, почувствовав прилив решимости, она поспешно сказала:</p>
<p>— Вы знаете, мистер Дарси, я ужасная эгоистка. Чтобы облегчить собственную душу, мне ничего не стоит невзначай взвалить бремя на вашу. Так вот, я больше не в силах удерживаться от того, чтобы выразить вам благодарность за вашу необыкновенную заботу о моей злосчастной сестре. С первого же дня, как мне стало известно о вашем поступке, я все время испытываю жгучую потребность сказать вам, как сильно это чувство меня волнует. И если бы о вашей роли узнала моя семья, мне, разумеется, не пришлось бы благодарить вас только от собственного имени.</p>
<p>— Мне неприятно, право же, очень неприятно, что вы об этом узнали, — растерянно ответил Дарси. — Представленные в неверном свете, эти сведения могли вас напрасно обеспокоить. Я не предполагал, что миссис Гардинер так мало заслуживает доверия.</p>
<p>— О нет, вам вовсе не следует сердиться на мою тетушку. Ваше участие в этом деле мне стало известно прежде всего благодаря легкомыслию Лидии. И, разумеется, я не могла спать спокойно, пока мне не удалось разузнать подробности. Итак, все же позвольте еще раз вполне серьезно поблагодарить вас от лица всей нашей семьи за великодушие, с которым вы приняли на себя так много хлопот и перенесли столько неприятностей в поисках беглецов.</p>
<p>— Если вам непременно нужно меня благодарить, — ответил он, — пусть это исходит от вас одной. Я не могу отрицать, что желание вас порадовать было одной из причин, побудивших меня вмешаться. Остальные члены вашей семьи, при всем моем к ним уважении, не обязаны мне ничем — я думал только о вас.</p>
<p>Элизабет была слишком смущена, чтобы что-то сказать. После непродолжительного молчания ее спутник добавил:</p>
<p>— Вы слишком великодушны, чтобы играть моим сердцем. Если ваше отношение ко мне с тех пор, как мы с вами разговаривали в апреле, не изменилось, скажите сразу. Мои чувства и все мои помыслы неизменны. Но вам достаточно произнести слово, и я больше не заговорю о них никогда.</p>
<p>Всей душой понимая неловкость его положения, Элизабет заставила себя ответить. И сразу, хоть и не очень красноречиво, она дала ему понять, что за истекшее время стала смотреть на него совсем по-другому и теперь с благодарностью и радостью принимает его сегодняшние заверения. Такого ощущения счастья, которое при этом его охватило, он еще никогда не испытывал. И он постарался выразить его столь пламенными и глубоко прочувствованными словами, какие могли найтись только у человека, охваченного истинной страстью. Если бы Элизабет была способна взглянуть ему в глаза, она увидела бы, как красило его выражение искреннего восторга. Но хотя она не осмеливалась на него смотреть, она могла его слушать. И пока он высказывал ей, как много она для него значила, его привязанность к ней становилась для нее все дороже и дороже.</p>
<p>Они шли вперед, сами не зная куда. Слишком многое нужно было обдумать, почувствовать, сказать, чтобы внимание могло сосредоточиться на чем-то постороннем. Вскоре Элизабет обнаружила, что понять друг друга им во многом помогли усилия леди Кэтрин. Тетка и впрямь встретилась с ним, проезжая через Лондон, и рассказала ему о своей поездке в Лонгборн, о причине этой поездки и о разговоре с Элизабет. Особенно леди Кэтрин напирала на то, что ответы мисс Беннет ясно доказывали ее наглость и испорченность. Разумеется, она не сомневалась, что это поможет ей вырвать у племянника заверение, которого она не добилась в Лонгборне. Но, на беду ее светлости, рассказ произвел обратное действие.</p>
<p>— Это вселило в меня надежду на то, — добавил он, — о чем я до той поры не смел и мечтать. Я знал вашу прямоту и понимал, что если бы вы решительно были настроены против меня, то сказали бы об этом моей тетке без обиняков.</p>
<p>Покраснев и засмеявшись, она ответила:</p>
<p>— О да, вы достаточно знакомы с моей откровенностью. И вполне могли считать, что я на это способна. После того как я разбранила вас прямо в лицо, мне, конечно, ничего не стоило высказать свое мнение о вас кому-нибудь из вашей родни.</p>
<p>— Но разве вы что-нибудь обо мне сказали, чего я не заслуживал? И хотя ваше недовольство мной основывалось на ошибочных сведениях и исходило из ложных предпосылок, мое поведение в тот вечер было достойно самого сурового осуждения. Оно было непростительным. Я не могу о нем вспомнить без содрогания.</p>
<p>— Давайте не спорить о том, чья вина была в этот вечер больше, — сказала Элизабет. — Каждый из нас, если судить строго, вел себя небезупречно. Надеюсь все же, что с той поры мы оба немного набрались учтивости.</p>
<p>— Я не могу себя простить так легко. Память о том, что я тогда наговорил, — о моем поведении, манерах, словах, — все эти месяцы не давала мне покоя. Никогда не забуду вашего справедливого упрека. «Если бы вы вели себя, как подобает благородному человеку…» — сказали вы тогда. Вы не знаете, не можете вообразить, какую боль причинили мне этой фразой. Хотя лишь спустя некоторое время я, признаюсь, понял, насколько вы были правы.</p>
<p>— Но мне даже в голову не приходило, что эти слова произведут такое действие. Я вовсе не думала, что они вас так сильно заденут.</p>
<p>— Легко этому верю. Вы ведь в самом деле тогда считали, что я лишен естественных человеческих чувств. Я никогда не забуду выражения вашего лица, когда вы сказали, что я не мог бы найти ни одного способа предложить вам свою руку, который склонил бы вас ее принять.</p>
<p>— Прошу вас, не надо больше повторять сказанного мной в тот вечер. Все это было ошибкой и должно быть забыто. Мне уже давно стыдно об этом вспоминать.</p>
<p>Дарси коснулся своего письма.</p>
<p>— Интересно, — спросил он, — сразу ли оно заставило вас обо мне лучше подумать? Когда вы его читали, вы ему верили?</p>
<p>Она рассказала, какое впечатление произвело на нее письмо и как постепенно рассеивалось ее предубеждение.</p>
<p>— Я знал, — сказал Дарси, — что оно причинит вам боль. Но это было необходимо. Надеюсь, вы его уничтожили? Мне было бы неприятно, если бы вы сейчас перечли некоторые места — особенно в первой части. Я припоминаю отдельные фразы, за которые меня можно возненавидеть.</p>
<p>— Если, по вашему, для прочности моей привязанности это важно, я его сожгу. Но оно не может повлиять на мои чувства — они не настолько изменчивы. Хотя, как мы оба знаем, <em>иногда</em> они меняются.</p>
<p>— Когда я писал это письмо, — заметил Дарси, — мне казалось, что я холоден и спокоен. Но теперь-то я знаю, что оно было написано в минуту высочайшего душевного напряжения.</p>
<p>— Письмо поначалу и вправду резкое, хотя дальше оно становилось совсем другим. Прощальная фраза — само милосердие. Но давайте о нем не думать. Чувства того, кто его писал, и той, которая его прочла, настолько изменились, что связанные с ним неприятные обстоятельства должны быть забыты. Одна из моих философских заповедей, с которыми я еще вас познакомлю, гласит: «Вспоминай что-нибудь только тогда, когда это доставляет тебе удовольствие».</p>
<p>— Признаюсь, я не очень-то высоко оцениваю подобную философию. Вам в своих воспоминаниях настолько не в чем себя упрекнуть, что ваше спокойствие зиждется не на философии, а на основании более надежном — чистой совести. Со мной все по-другому. Я не смею, не должен отвергать приходящие в голову мучительные воспоминания. Всю жизнь я был эгоистом если не по образу мыслей, то, во всяком случае, в поступках. Когда я был ребенком, мне дали понятие о правильном и неправильном, но не показали, как надо лепить своей характер. Мне привили хорошие принципы, но позволили следовать им с гордостью и высокомерием. Будучи, на свою беду, единственным сыном (а в течение многих лет — и единственным ребенком), я был испорчен моими излишне великодушными родителями (мой отец был особенно добрым и отзывчивым человеком). Они допускали, одобряли, почти воспитывали во мне эгоизм и властность, пренебрежение ко всем, кто находился за пределами нашего семейного круга, презрение ко всему остальному миру, готовность ни во что не ставить ум и заслуги других людей по сравнению с моими собственными. Таким я был от восьми до двадцати восьми лет. И таким бы я оставался до сих пор, если бы не вы, мой чудеснейший, мой дорогой друг Элизабет! Чем только я вам не обязан! Вы преподали мне урок, который поначалу показался мне, правда, горьким, но на самом деле был необыкновенно полезным. Вы научили меня душевному смирению. Я предложил вам руку, не сомневаясь, что она будет принята. А вы мне показали, насколько при всех моих достоинствах я не заслуживаю того, чтобы меня полюбила женщина, любовью которой стоит по-настоящему дорожить.</p>
<p>— Неужели вы тогда считали, что я могу принять ваше предложение?</p>
<p>— В том-то и дело! Что скажете вы о моем тщеславии? Мне казалось, вы добиваетесь, ждете моего признания.</p>
<p>— Стало быть, мое поведение в чем-то было неправильным, — хоть и против моего желания, поверьте. Я вовсе не хотела вас обманывать. Но мой веселый нрав вполне мог завести меня не туда, куда следует. Как вы должны были ненавидеть меня после этого вечера!</p>
<p>— Вас ненавидеть? Быть может, вначале я и рассердился. Но вскоре мой гнев обрушился на того, кто его заслужил.</p>
<p>— Я едва решаюсь спросить, что вы обо мне подумали, встретившись со мной в Пемберли. Вы осуждали меня за то, что я там появилась?</p>
<p>— Что вы, нисколько. Я просто был крайне удивлен.</p>
<p>— Вы не могли быть удивлены тогда больше, чем я. Совесть подсказывала мне, что я вовсе не заслуживаю любезного обращения, и, признаюсь, я вполне ожидала, что со мной и поступят по заслугам.</p>
<p>— А мне хотелось тогда, — ответил Дарси, — оказать вам все внимание, на какое я был способен, и убедить вас, что я не злопамятен. Я надеялся добиться прощения, старался рассеять дурное обо мне мнение, показав, что ваши укоры пошли мне на пользу. Не могу точно сказать, когда у меня появились и некоторые другие желания, — думаю, что не позже чем через полчаса после того, как я вас увидел.</p>
<p>Он рассказал, насколько она понравилась его сестре и как Джорджиану огорчило, что их знакомство было внезапно прервано. Отсюда рассказ его, естественно, перешел к тому, чем это было вызвано. И Элизабет узнала, что решение уехать из Дербишира на поиски Лидии созрело у него еще до того, как он покинул гостиницу. Его задумчивый и печальный вид в ту минуту объяснялся переживаемой им внутренней борьбой.</p>
<p>Она еще раз выразила ему свою благодарность, но для обоих это была слишком больная тема, и они скоро умолкли.</p>
<p>Пройдя незаметно несколько миль и взглянув на часы, они вдруг обнаружили, что им следовало уже вернуться домой. Поинтересовавшись, куда могли запропаститься Бингли и Джейн, они заговорили об этой молодой паре. Дарси радовался их обручению, о котором его друг немедленно ему рассказал.</p>
<p>— Скажите, вы были этим удивлены? — спросила Элизабет.</p>
<p>— Нисколько. Перед отъездом я уже понимал, что обручение вот-вот состоится.</p>
<p>— Иными словами, вы на него дали согласие? Я так и предполагала.</p>
<p>И хотя он стал против такого вывода возражать, она поняла, что дело обстояло именно так.</p>
<p>— Накануне моего отъезда в Лондон, — продолжал Дарси, — я признался ему в том, в чем, вероятно, должен был признаться гораздо раньше. Я рассказал, насколько грубо и безосновательно вмешался в его судьбу. Он был крайне удивлен, ибо ему это даже не приходило в голову. Я сказал также, что, вероятно, ошибся, считая, что ваша сестра не отвечает на его чувства. При этом я убедился, что его склонность к ней не исчезла, и поэтому будущий счастливый союз не вызывал у меня сомнений.</p>
<p>То, как свободно он распоряжался поведением друга, не могло не вызвать ее улыбки.</p>
<p>— Вы сказали ему, что Джейн его любит, — спросила Элизабет, — на основе собственных наблюдений или со слов, услышанных от меня весной?</p>
<p>— Я убедился в этом своими глазами. Присмотревшись к ней во время двух последних визитов в Лонгборн, я больше не мог сомневаться в ее чувствах.</p>
<p>— Ну, а ваши слова убедили его сразу, не так ли?</p>
<p>— О да. Бингли и впрямь необычайно скромен. Неуверенность в себе не позволяла ему положиться в таком важном деле на собственное суждение. Но благодаря тому, что он мне вполне доверяет, все встало на свое место. Я должен был открыть ему одно обстоятельство, которое поначалу его справедливо раздосадовало. Я не позволил себе оставить его в неведении, что ваша сестра провела три зимних месяца в Лондоне, что мне это было известно и что я об этом сознательно ничего ему не сказал. Он был рассержен. Но гнев его, я уверен, рассеялся, как только он перестал сомневаться в чувствах вашей сестры. Сейчас он уже от души меня простил.</p>
<p>У Элизабет вертелось на языке замечание о том, каким незаменимым другом является Бингли, готовый следовать любым советам своего старшего товарища. Но, вспомнив, что ей еще предстояло приучить его к своим шуткам, она сдержалась. Приниматься за это сейчас было еще слишком рискованно. Остаток пути заняли рассуждения ее спутника о будущем семейном счастье Бингли, которое будет уступать только счастью самого Дарси.</p>
<p>В холле они расстались.</p>

<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XVII</p>
</div>
<p>— Лиззи, дорогая, где вы так долго пропадали? — Этим вопросом встретила ее Джейн сразу, как только Элизабет вошла в комнату. Тот же вопрос задали ей и остальные члены семьи, пока все рассаживались за столом. Покраснев, она сумела только ответить, что они забрели в незнакомые места. Но ни краска на ее лице, ни какие-нибудь другие обстоятельства не вызвали ни малейших подозрений.</p>
<p>Вечер прошел тихо, без происшествий. Признанные влюбленные болтали и смеялись, непризнанные — молчали. Дарси не было свойственно искать выхода своим счастливым чувствам в бурном веселье, а взволнованная и смущенная Элизабет скорее сознавала свое счастье, нежели его переживала. Помимо обычной неловкости, которую при таких обстоятельствах испытывает всякая молодая девица, ее угнетали и многие другие опасения. Она заранее представляла себе, как примут известие об их помолвке члены ее семьи. И, хорошо зная, что, кроме Джейн, все относятся к Дарси с большой неприязнью, она боялась, как бы это чувство не оказалось настолько сильным, что ни его состояние, ни положение в обществе не смогут его рассеять.</p>
<p>Перед сном она призналась во всем своей сестре. И хотя обычно Джейн не сомневалась в ее словах, на сей раз она проявила крайнюю недоверчивость.</p>
<p>— Ты шутишь, Лиззи? Этого не может быть! Помолвлена с мистером Дарси! Нет, ты меня обманываешь. Я знаю, это невозможно.</p>
<p>— Что ж, начало и впрямь малообещающее. Я только на тебя и надеялась. Если даже ты мне не веришь, как же я заставлю поверить других? Джейн, милая, я говорю серьезно. Чистую правду. Он до сих пор меня любит, и мы помолвлены.</p>
<p>Джейн недоверчиво взглянула на сестру.</p>
<p>— Ах, Лиззи, это совершенно невероятно. Я знаю, ты ведь его терпеть не можешь.</p>
<p>— Ты ничего не знаешь. Старое следует начисто забыть. Быть может, я не всегда его любила так, как сейчас. Но хорошая память при таких обстоятельствах непростительна. И сейчас я вспоминаю об этом в последний раз.</p>
<p>Мисс Беннет не знала, что и подумать. Элизабет снова и еще более серьезно уверила ее, что все сказанное — сущая правда.</p>
<p>— Боже милостивый! — воскликнула Джейн. — Неужели это могло случиться? И, однако, я должна тебе теперь верить. Лиззи, дорогая, я хотела бы, я была бы рада тебя искренне поздравить. Но ты уверена, — прости мне этот вопрос, — ты вполне убеждена, что будешь с ним счастлива?</p>
<p>— Можешь в этом не сомневаться. Мы уже решили, что будем счастливейшей супружеской парой на свете. Но ты не огорчена, Джейн? Сумеешь ли ты полюбить такого брата?</p>
<p>— Конечно же, всей душой! Для нас с Бингли это самая большая радость. Мы с ним говорили о такой возможности и, увы, решили, что она исключается. Но ты вправду его любишь? Ах, Лиззи, делай все что угодно, но только не выходи замуж без любви! Ты убеждена, что испытываешь к нему достаточно сильное чувство?</p>
<p>— О да! Когда я тебе признаюсь во всем, ты найдешь, что я его люблю слишком сильно.</p>
<p>— Что ты имеешь в виду?</p>
<p>— Что, по совести говоря, я люблю его больше, чем мистера Бингли. Боюсь, ты на меня за это рассердишься!</p>
<p>— Лиззи, родная, постарайся удержаться от шуток. Нам же нужно поговорить серьезно. Расскажи мне сейчас же все, чего я не знаю. Ты давно его любишь?</p>
<p>— Чувство росло во мне так постепенно, что я сама не могу сказать, когда оно возникло. Пожалуй, однако, началом можно считать тот день, когда я впервые увидела его восхитительное поместье в Дербишире…</p>
<p>Новый призыв к серьезности достиг желанной цели. И Элизабет вскоре вполне убедила сестру в своей глубокой привязанности к мистеру Дарси. Когда наконец Джейн полностью в этом уверилась, ей больше ничего не оставалось желать.</p>
<p>— Теперь я по-настоящему счастлива! — сказала она. — Твоя жизнь будет такой же радостной, как и моя. Я всегда была высокого мнения о мистере Дарси. Одна только любовь к тебе служила ему в моих глазах прекрасной рекомендацией. Но теперь, в качестве друга Бингли и твоего мужа, он станет для меня самым дорогим человеком на свете после тебя и Бингли. Но, Лиззи, откуда в тебе столько лукавства? Оказывается, ты от меня так много скрывала! Я ведь почти ничего не знала, что произошло в Пемберли и Лэмтоне. Все, что мне об этом было известно, я узнавала от других.</p>
<p>Элизабет объяснила ей причины своей скрытности. В то время она не хотела напоминать сестре о мистере Бингли. И, еще недостаточно разобравшись в собственных чувствах, она в равной степени избегала имени мистера Дарси. Однако теперь ей уже не к чему было скрывать роль Дарси в замужестве Лидии. И после того как все было сказано, они провели в разговорах еще половину ночи.</p>
<p>— Боже мой, — воскликнула на следующее утро, стоя у окна, миссис Беннет. — Неужели этот несносный мистер Дарси опять увязался за нашим дорогим Бингли? О чем только он думает, проводя у нас с такой назойливостью целые дни? Я бы нисколько не возражала, если бы он отправился на охоту или занялся другими делами и не стеснял бы нас своим присутствием. Что же мы сегодня будем с ним делать? Лиззи, придется тебе опять вытащить его на прогулку, чтобы он не мешал Бингли.</p>
<p>Элизабет едва удержалась от улыбки, настолько ее устраивало это предложение. Вместе с тем то, что ее мать постоянно сопровождала его имя подобными эпитетами, не могло ее не уязвлять.</p>
<p>Как только молодые люди вошли, Бингли посмотрел на нее так выразительно и пожал ей руку с таким жаром, что нельзя было сомневаться в его осведомленности. Вскоре он сказал:</p>
<p>— Миссис Беннет, не найдется ли здесь в округе еще каких-нибудь мест для прогулок, где Лиззи снова могла бы заблудиться?</p>
<p>— Я бы посоветовала мистеру Дарси, Лиззи и Китти отправиться с утра на Оукхемский холм, — отвечала миссис Беннет. — Это отличная прогулка, а мистер Дарси еще там не бывал.</p>
<p>— Что касается остальных участников, — сказал мистер Бингли, — им это вполне подойдет. Но Китти, пожалуй, будет трудно туда добраться, не правда ли, Китти?</p>
<p>Китти подтвердила, что она предпочла бы остаться дома. В то же время мистер Дарси необыкновенно заинтересовался видом с холма, и Элизабет молча согласилась его туда проводить. Когда она пошла к себе, чтобы приготовиться к прогулке, миссис Беннет, выйдя за ней, шепнула ей по дороге:</p>
<p>— Мне жаль, Лиззи, что тебе приходится брать на себя заботу об этом несносном человеке. Но ты, я надеюсь, не возражаешь? Тебе ведь понятно, — все делается ради Джейн. И тебе вовсе не нужно с ним разговаривать. Довольно сказать одно-два слова, пусть это тебя не тревожит.</p>
<p>Во время прогулки было решено испросить в этот вечер согласие мистера Беннета. Объяснение с матерью Элизабет взяла на себя. Как она воспримет известие, было трудно предвидеть. Иногда Элизабет начинала сомневаться, сможет ли все богатство и знатность Дарси смягчить ее неприязнь к этому человеку. Но приведет ли ее будущий союз в негодование или восторг, — поведение матери в эту минуту все равно не могло оказать чести ее уму. И для Элизабет было одинаково невыносимо, чтобы Дарси присутствовал при первом взрыве восторга или приступе негодования миссис Беннет.</p>
<p>Вечером, вскоре после того как мистер Беннет удалился в библиотеку, Элизабет увидела, как мистер Дарси последовал за ним. Она испытывала крайнюю тревогу. Едва ли она боялась, что ее отец откажет мистеру Дарси. Но ему предстояло большое огорчение, и то, что она, его любимое дитя, должна опечалить отца своим выбором и вызвать в нем опасения за ее судьбу, было ей очень неприятно и заставляло ее сильно волноваться. В нервическом беспокойстве просидела она до возвращения Дарси и, только взглянув на него и заметив легкую улыбку на его лице, почувствовала некоторое облегчение. Через несколько минут он подошел к столу, за которым она вместе с Китти занималась шитьем, и, сделав вид, что любуется ее работой, прошептал:</p>
<p>— Зайдите к отцу, он ждет вас в библиотеке.</p>
<p>Она сейчас же туда пошла.</p>
<p>Отец с мрачным и встревоженным видом расхаживал по комнате.</p>
<p>— Лиззи, — обратился он к ней, — что с тобой случилось? В уме ли ты? Неужели ты вздумала выйти за него замуж? Разве ты не относилась к нему всегда с неприязнью?</p>
<p>Как горько жалела она в эту минуту, что в своих прежних высказываниях не проявляла достаточной сдержанности и осторожности! Если бы раньше она вела себя по-другому, сейчас она была бы избавлена от неприятнейших объяснений. Но теперь эти объяснения были неизбежны, и Элизабет со смущенным видом заверила отца в своем чувстве к мистеру Дарси.</p>
<p>— Значит, другими словами, ты решила выйти за него замуж. Что ж, конечно, он очень богат, и у тебя будет больше красивых платьев и экипажей, чем у Джейн. Но разве ты от этого станешь счастливой?</p>
<p>— У вас есть какие-нибудь другие возражения, кроме того, что вы не верите моему чувству?</p>
<p>— Ровно никаких. Мы все считали его гордым и не очень приятным человеком, но это бы не имело значения, если бы ты действительно его полюбила.</p>
<p>— Но я же его люблю, люблю всей душой! — отвечала она со слезами на глазах. — Я люблю его. И его напрасно считают гордецом. На самом деле он превосходный человек. Вы совсем не знаете, что он собой представляет. И я прошу вас, не делайте мне больно, говоря о нем таким тоном.</p>
<p>— Лиззи, — проговорил мистер Беннет, — я дал согласие. Он принадлежит к тем людям, которым я не осмеливаюсь отказывать, если они соизволят меня о чем-то просить. Теперь от тебя зависит — быть ли ему твоим мужем. Но позволь дать тебе совет — подумай об этом хорошенько. Я знаю твой характер, Лиззи. Я знаю, ты не сможешь быть счастливой, не сможешь себя уважать, если не будешь ценить своего мужа, — смотреть на него снизу вверх. Твое остроумие и жизнерадостность грозят тебе, в случае неравного брака, многими бедами. Едва ли при этом ты сможешь избежать разочарования и отчаянья. Дитя мое, избавь меня от горя, которое я должен буду испытать, увидев, что ты потеряла уважение к спутнику жизни. Ты плохо себе представляешь, что это такое на самом деле.</p>
<p>Еще более взволнованная, Элизабет отвечала серьезно и искренне. Повторно заверив его, что мистер Дарси — ее настоящий избранник, она рассказала отцу, как постепенно менялись ее взгляды на этого человека. С восторгом перечислив его достоинства, она выразила абсолютную уверенность, что любовь Дарси к ней не мимолетное увлечение, поскольку эта любовь уже выдержала многие месяцы серьезного испытания, не встречая ответного чувства. И в конце концов ей удалось рассеять недоверие мистера Беннета и примирить его со своим предстоящим замужеством.</p>
<p>— Что ж, дорогая, — проговорил он, когда она замолчала. — Больше мне нечего тебе сказать. Если все, что я услышал, — правда, он заслуживает того, чтобы стать твоим мужем. Я не мог бы, Лиззи, расстаться с тобой ради менее достойного человека.</p>
<p>Для того, чтобы еще больше поднять в глазах мистера Беннета своего жениха, она рассказала отцу о том, что Дарси добровольно сделал для Лидии.</p>
<p>— Сегодня у нас в самом деле вечер чудес! Значит, все эти переговоры, расходы по свадебному контракту, выплата долгов Уикхема и покупка офицерского патента — дело рук Дарси? Что же, тем лучше. Это освобождает меня от множества забот и расходов. Если бы все сделал твой дядя, мне бы следовало — мне бы пришлось с ним рассчитаться. Но эти неистовые влюбленные молодые люди всегда поступают по-своему. Завтра я предложу ему вернуть долг. Он начнет протестовать и наговорит всякий вздор, настаивая на своей страстной любви к тебе. И тогда с делом будет покончено.</p>
<p>Тут мистер Беннет вспомнил, как она была смущена несколько дней тому назад при чтении письма мистера Коллинза. И, вдоволь посмеявшись над ней, он в конце концов отпустил ее, сказав:</p>
<p>— Если какие-нибудь молодые люди явятся за Мэри и Китти, можешь их направить ко мне, у меня сейчас есть свободное время.</p>
<p>С души Элизабет свалилась величайшая тяжесть. И после получасовых сосредоточенных размышлений у себя в комнате она смогла достаточно успокоиться, чтобы вернуться в гостиную. Пережитые волнения были еще слишком свежи в ее памяти, чтобы она могла предаваться веселью, и остаток вечера прошел очень тихо. Но дальше ей уже нечего было бояться, и ее постепенно охватывало ощущение легкости и спокойствия.</p>
<p>Когда ее мать поднялась перед сном к себе в гардеробную, Элизабет отправилась за ней и сообщила ей важную новость. Слова ее произвели ошеломляющее действие. Выслушав их, миссис Беннет некоторое время сидела в полном молчании, будучи не в силах что-нибудь произнести. Хотя обычно ее ум достаточно быстро усваивал все, что было выгодно для ее дочерей или хотя бы отдаленно касалось какого-нибудь их поклонника, прошло немало времени, прежде чем она смогла уразуметь смысл того, что ей рассказала Элизабет. В конце концов она начала приходить в себя, стала вертеться в кресле, вскакивала, садилась, изумлялась и благословляла судьбу.</p>
<p>— Боже праведный! Благословение неба! Подумать только! Что со мной делается? Мистер Дарси! Кто мог бы себе представить? Это на самом деле правда? Лиззи, душенька моя! Какая ты будешь богатая и знатная! Сколько у тебя будет денег на мелкие расходы! Сколько драгоценностей, карет! Джейн даже и сравниться с тобой не сможет. Я в таком восторге, так счастлива! Какой очаровательный молодой человек! Такой статный! Такой высокий! Ах, Лиззи, миленькая! Ради бога, извинись перед ним за то, что я раньше его недолюбливала. Надеюсь, он об этом забудет. Душенька, душенька Лиззи! Дом в городе! Любая роскошь! Три дочери замужем! Десять тысяч в год! Боже! Что со мной будет? Я теряю рассудок.</p>
<p>Этого было достаточно, чтобы больше не сомневаться в ее согласии. И Элизабет, радуясь, что все душевные излияния матери были услышаны ею одной, вскоре удалилась к себе. Но ей довелось провести в одиночестве не больше трех минут. Миссис Беннет сама прибежала к ней в комнату.</p>
<p>— Девочка моя! Десять тысяч в год, а может быть, даже больше! Все равно что выйти за лорда! И особое разрешение, — ты непременно должна будешь выходить замуж по особому разрешению. Но, дорогая моя, скажи, какое кушанье мистер Дарси больше всего любит к обеду? Я его велю завтра же приготовить.</p>
<p>Это было не слишком хорошим предзнаменованием будущего обращения матери с ее женихом. И Элизабет поняла, что даже после того, как она убедилась в самой нежной привязанности к ней мистера Дарси и заручилась согласием родителей, у нее останутся неосуществленные желания. Однако утро прошло гораздо более благополучно, чем она ожидала. Миссис Беннет испытывала такое благоговение перед будущим зятем, что была не в состоянии с ним разговаривать, кроме тех случаев, когда могла оказать ему какую-нибудь услугу или выразить согласие с его мнением.</p>
<p>Элизабет обрадовалась, увидев, что отец старается ближе познакомиться с Дарси. И вскоре мистер Беннет уверил ее, что с каждым часом его мнение о Дарси становится все более благоприятным.</p>
<p>— Все три зятя кажутся мне великолепными. Боюсь, правда, что Уикхем останется моим любимцем. Но твой муж будет мне нравиться, возможно, не меньше, чем Бингли.</p>
<p></span><span id="id63"></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XVIII</p>
</div>
<p>Элизабет вскоре опять пришла в достаточно веселое расположение духа, чтобы потребовать от мистера Дарси отчета о том, как его угораздило в нее влюбиться.</p>
<p>— С чего это началось? — спросила она. — Я представляю себе дальнейший ход, но что послужило первым толчком?</p>
<p>— Мне теперь трудно назвать определенный час, или место, или взгляд, или слово, когда был сделан первый шаг. Слишком это было давно. И я понял, что со мной происходит, только тогда, когда уже был на середине пути.</p>
<p>— Не правда ли, сначала моя внешность вам не понравилась? А что касается моих манер, — мое обращение с вами всегда было на грани невежливого. Не было случая, чтобы, разговаривая с вами, я не старалась вам досадить. В самом деле, не влюбились ли вы в меня за мою дерзость?</p>
<p>— Я полюбил вас за ваш живой ум.</p>
<p>— Вы вполне можете называть это дерзостью. Да оно почти так и было. Ведь в том дело и заключалось, что вам опротивели любезность, внимательность и угодничество, с которыми к вам относились все окружающие. Вас тошнило от женщин, у которых в мыслях, в глазах и на языке была лишь забота о том, как бы заслужить вашу благосклонность. Я привлекла к себе ваше внимание и интерес именно тем, что оказалась вовсе на них не похожей. Не будь у вас золотого сердца, вы бы меня за это возненавидели. Но при всех ваших стараниях скрыть свою истинную натуру чувства ваши всегда были благородны и справедливы. И в душе вы питали глубокое презрение ко всем, кто за вами так прилежно ухаживал. Что ж — вот я и избавила вас от труда давать мне какие-нибудь объяснения. В самом деле, принимая во внимание все обстоятельства, то, что я говорю, кажется мне разумным. Конечно, о настоящих моих достоинствах вы и не подозреваете. Но ведь, когда влюбляются, о них и не думают.</p>
<p>— Разве вы не доказали свою доброту, нежно заботясь о Джейн во время ее болезни в Незерфилде?</p>
<p>— Джейн — ангел! Кто бы не сделал для нее того же? Впрочем, пусть вам это кажется добродетелью. Мои хорошие качества находятся теперь под вашей опекой, и вам следует превозносить их как можно больше. А мне подобает выискивать в ответ любые поводы для того, чтобы с вами ссориться и вас поддразнивать. И я собираюсь приступить к этому без промедления. Позвольте-ка спросить — почему вы так долго уклонялись от решительного объяснения? Что заставляло вас упорно меня сторониться при вашем первом визите и позже, когда вы с Бингли у нас обедали? Ведь вы вели себя, особенно при первом посещении, так, будто вам до меня нет дела.</p>
<p>— У вас был неприступный и мрачный вид. И вы меня ничем не ободрили.</p>
<p>— Но ведь я была смущена!</p>
<p>— И я тоже.</p>
<p>— И вы не смогли со мной переговорить, когда приезжали к нам на обед?</p>
<p>— Человек, который испытывал бы меньшее чувство, наверно, бы смог.</p>
<p>— Экая беда, — у вас на все находятся разумные отговорки. А я оказываюсь столь рассудительной, что сразу с ними соглашаюсь. Но интересно, долго ли вы откладывали бы объяснение, будучи предоставлены себе самому? Когда бы наконец вы мне признались, если бы я на это не напросилась? Не правда ли, немалую роль сыграло мое решение поблагодарить вас за спасение Лидии? Боюсь даже, непозволительную. До какой безнравственности мы дойдем, если построим свое благополучие на нарушении обещания держать язык за зубами? Плохи же наши дела!</p>
<p>— Вы не должны огорчаться. И не тревожьтесь за свои моральные принципы. С моей нерешительностью покончила моя тетка, которая так бесцеремонно пыталась нас разлучить. И сегодняшним блаженством я обязан не вашей решимости выразить мне благодарность. Я не собирался ждать первого шага с вашей стороны. Сообщение леди Кэтрин позволило мне надеяться, и я решил сразу узнать о своем приговоре.</p>
<p>— Леди Кэтрин оказала нам неоценимую услугу. Ее это должно радовать. Приносить повсеместно пользу — ее страсть. Но скажите, с какой целью вы приехали в Незерфилд? Неужели только чтобы почувствовать себя смущенным при посещении Лонгборна? Или у вас были более далеко идущие планы?</p>
<p>— Моей истинной целью было — повидать вас. Я хотел понять, есть ли у меня какая-то надежда добиться вашей любви. А признавался я себе только в одном — желании проверить, сохранила ли ваша сестра привязанность к Бингли. И в случае если бы я в этом удостоверился, я решил перед ним исповедаться. Позднее я на самом деле так поступил.</p>
<p>— Хватит ли у вас когда-нибудь смелости сообщить леди Кэтрин о том, что ее ожидает?</p>
<p>— Скорее мне не хватает не смелости, а времени. Но это должно быть сделано, и, если вы дадите мне лист бумаги, я сделаю это тотчас же.</p>
<p>— А я — если бы не должна была сесть за письмо сама, — могла бы усесться рядом и восхищаться вашим умением ровно выводить строчки, — как уже однажды делала некая молодая леди. Но у меня тоже есть тетка. И я не имею права больше о ней забывать.</p>
<p>Элизабет до сих пор не ответила на пространное письмо миссис Гардинер. В свое время ей было трудно признаться, что догадки тетушки о ее отношениях с мистером Дарси были сильно преувеличены. Но теперь она могла сообщить ей необыкновенно приятную новость. И Элизабет почувствовала себя пристыженной, вспомнив, что ее тетя и дядя уже потеряли три дня, в течение которых могли бы радоваться ее счастью. Поэтому она отправила им следующее послание:</p>
<p>«Я должна была сразу поблагодарить Вас, моя дорогая тетушка, за Ваш подробный, дружеский и столь исчерпывающий ответ. Но, говоря по правде, мне было трудно писать. Своими догадками Вы опередили события. Зато теперь Вы уже можете предположить все что хотите. Дайте волю Вашей фантазии. Разрешите ей нарисовать в Вашем воображении любую картину. И все же, если только Вам не придет в голову, что я уже замужем, Вы ошибетесь не очень сильно. Вы должны написать мне еще раз как можно скорее, перечислив при этом достоинства моего избранника гораздо подробнее, чем Вы это сделали в прошлом письме. Еще и еще раз благодарю Вас за то, что Вы не захотели поехать в Озерный край. Как я была глупа, когда об этом мечтала! Ваша идея о низеньком фаэтоне мне очень понравилась. Мы будем с Вами кататься по парку каждое утро. Я теперь — самое счастливое существо на земле. Быть может, то же самое произносили до меня и другие. Но ни у кого не было для этого стольких оснований. Я даже счастливее Джейн. Она только улыбается, а я — хохочу! Мистер Дарси выражает Вам всю свою любовь, которую он утаил от меня. Вы должны непременно приехать в Пемберли на Рождество.</p>
<p><em>Ваша и т.д.».</em></p>
<p>Письмо мистера Дарси к леди Кэтрин выглядело совсем по-другому. И совсем непохожим на оба послания был ответ мистера Беннета на последнее письмо мистера Коллинза:</p>
<p>«Дорогой сэр, вам придется еще раз позаботиться о поздравлениях. Элизабет вскоре станет супругой мистера Дарси. Утешьте леди Кэтрин, насколько это будет в Ваших силах. Но будь я на Вашем месте, я бы поставил на племянника. У него больше возможностей.</p>
<p><em>Искренне Ваш и т.д.».</em></p>
<p>Поздравление мисс Бингли, полученное ее братом в связи с его предстоящей женитьбой, было необыкновенно приторным и фальшивым. Она написала даже Джейн, выразив ей свой восторг и напомнив об их прежних дружеских чувствах. И хотя Джейн не была обманута этим письмом, оно все же настолько ее тронуло, что она не удержалась и ответила, как она сама сознавала, гораздо приветливее, чем заслуживала ее будущая невестка.</p>
<p>Радость, которую выразила по такому же поводу мисс Дарси, была столь же искренней, каким было письмо, полученное ею от брата. Ей явно не хватило четырех страниц для выражений восторга и горячей надежды на то, что Элизабет сможет полюбить ее, как родную сестру.</p>
<p>Еще до того как мог быть получен ответ от мистера Коллинза или поздравление от его жены, жители Лонгборна узнали, что сами Коллинзы пожаловали в Лукас Лодж. Причина их столь поспешного приезда вскоре стала достаточно ясной. Леди Кэтрин была приведена письмом племянника в такую ярость, что Шарлотта, искренне радовавшаяся предстоящему браку, сочла за лучшее исчезнуть на то время, пока буря несколько не утихнет. Приезд подруги в такой момент несказанно обрадовал Элизабет. Однако, видя, как мистеру Дарси приходится во время их встреч переносить назойливые и напыщенные любезности ее мужа, она начала думать, что эта радость приобретается слишком дорогой ценой. Впрочем, мистер Дарси проявлял необыкновенную выдержку. Он даже научился более или менее спокойно выслушивать жалобы сэра Уильяма Лукаса на похищение величайшей драгоценности этого края, а также его надежду на встречу в Сент-Джеймсе. И если он по временам и пожимал плечами, то делал это, только когда сэр Уильям от него отворачивался.</p>
<p>Другое и, пожалуй, еще более тяжкое испытание ему приходилось выдерживать из-за вульгарности миссис Филипс. Правда, она, так же как и ее сестра, настолько благоговела перед ним, что не решалась с ним разговаривать с фамильярностью, какую поощрял в ней добродушный нрав Бингли. Однако любая сказанная ею фраза непременно звучала вульгарно. Почтение к Дарси заставляло ее быть молчаливой, но не улучшало ее манер. Элизабет делала все что могла, стараясь защитить Дарси от излишнего внимания мистера Коллинза и миссис Филипс. Благодаря ее стараниям большую часть дня он проводил либо с ней, либо в обществе тех ее близких, разговор с которыми не был ему в тягость. Хотя из-за подобных беспокойств период помолвки стал для Элизабет несколько менее радостным, будущее счастье казалось от этого еще более привлекательным. И она с восторгом предвкушала то время, когда они смогут вырваться из столь неприятного для них окружения и зажить спокойной и достойной семейной жизнью в Пемберли.</p>
<p></span><span id="id64"></span></p>
<div class="title4">
<p>ГЛАВА XIX</p>
</div>
<p>Счастливым для материнских чувств миссис Беннет стал день, в который она распростилась с двумя самыми достойными своими дочерьми! Легко можно себе представить, с каким восторгом и гордостью она после этого навещала миссис Бингли и говорила о миссис Дарси. И, ради ее семейства, я была бы рада сказать, что исполнение заветной мечты — выдать в короткое время замуж чуть ли не всех дочерей — произвело на нее такое благотворное влияние, что в конце жизни она наконец стала приятной и рассудительной женщиной. Однако, увы, она нисколько не поумнела и время от времени по-прежнему была подвержена нервическим припадкам — быть может, к счастью для своего мужа, который в противном случае не смог бы насладиться непривычным для него домашним уютом.</p>
<p>Мистеру Беннету очень недоставало его второй дочери, и его привязанность к ней заставляла его выезжать из дома чаще, чем любой другой повод. Он очень любил навещать Пемберли, в особенности когда его меньше всего там ждали.</p>
<p>Мистер Бингли и Джейн прожили в Незерфилде только около года. Столь близкое соседство с ее матерью и меритонскими родственниками оказалось нежелательным даже при его мягком нраве и ее нежном сердце. Заветная мечта его сестер наконец осуществилась, и он приобрел имение в графстве, граничащем с Дербиширом. Таким образом, Джейн и Элизабет, в дополнение ко всем другим радостям, оказались на расстоянии всего тридцати миль друг от друга.</p>
<p>Китти стала, с большой пользой для себя, проводить время в обществе двух старших сестер. Характер ее благодаря этому заметно улучшился. Она не была так упряма, как Лидия. И теперь, освобожденная от ее влияния, она под руководством Джейн и Элизабет стала менее раздражительной, менее вялой и менее невежественной. Разумеется, ее всячески оберегали от общества Лидии. И, несмотря на то что миссис Уикхем частенько приглашала ее к себе, соблазняя сестру балами и обществом молодых людей, мистер Беннет никогда не соглашался на такую поездку.</p>
<p>Единственной дочерью, которая продолжала оставаться в Лонгборне, была Мэри. Ей поневоле пришлось бросить заботу о самоусовершенствовании, так как миссис Беннет ни на минуту не могла оставаться в одиночестве. Таким образом Мэри стала принимать большее участие в жизни, хотя по-прежнему была способна читать наставления по поводу всякого пустяка. И уже не чувствуя себя уязвленной тем, что она менее красива, чем ее сестры, она, как и предполагал ее отец, согласилась с этой переменой без особых возражений.</p>
<p>Что касается Уикхема и Лидии, замужество старших сестер не отразилось на их характерах. То, что Элизабет должна была теперь узнать до конца о его непорядочности и неблагодарности, было принято им с философским спокойствием. Несмотря ни на что, он, возможно, не расставался с надеждой, что Дарси все же примет на себя заботу о его благосостоянии. Поздравительное письмо, полученное Элизабет ко дню свадьбы, свидетельствовало, что подобные надежды питал если и не он сам, то, во всяком случае, его жена. Вот что там говорилось:</p>
<p>«Моя дорогая Лиззи, желаю тебе всяческих радостей. И если ты любишь мистера Дарси хотя бы наполовину так сильно, как я люблю моего дорогого Уикхема, ты должна себя чувствовать очень счастливой. Хорошо, что ты станешь такой богатой! Надеюсь, когда тебе нечем будет заняться, ты вспомнишь о нас. Я уверена, что Уикхем был бы не прочь получить место при дворе, и боюсь, у нас не будет хватать денег, чтобы прожить без некоторой поддержки. Думаю, что нам подошло бы любое место с доходом в триста — четыреста фунтов в год. Однако, если ты не найдешь нужным, пожалуйста, не говори об этом мистеру Дарси.</p>
<p><em>Твоя и т.д.».</em></p>
<p>Так как ее сестра <em>вовсе</em> не находила это нужным, она постаралась в своем ответе положить конец всяким надеждам и притязаниям подобного рода. Тем не менее Элизабет нередко посылала им то, что ей удавалось отложить благодаря экономии в собственных тратах и находилось, таким образом, в ее личном распоряжении. Она отлично понимала, что средства, которыми располагали Уикхемы, были недостаточны для покрытия расходов двух людей, столь неумеренных в своих потребностях и столь мало заботящихся о будущем. И всякий раз, когда им приходилось переезжать с места на место, Элизабет или Джейн непременно должны были ждать просьбы о помощи в расплате с долгами. Образ жизни Уикхемов, даже после того как заключение мира позволило им вернуться на родину, остался крайне безалаберным. Они вечно переезжали, стараясь устроиться подешевле, и вечно тратили денег больше, чем могли себе позволить. Привязанность Уикхема к Лидии очень скоро уступила место полному безразличию. Ее привязанность к мужу просуществовала немногим дольше. И, несмотря на свою внешность и происхождение, она по-прежнему имела полное право на ту репутацию, которая за ней утвердилась, когда она выходила замуж.</p>
<p>Хотя Дарси никогда не соглашался принимать Уикхема в Пемберли, он все же, ради Элизабет, продолжал оказывать ему поддержку в его карьере. Лидия иногда гостила у них, в то время когда ее муж развлекался в Лондоне или Бате. А у Бингли оба проводили нередко так много времени, что против этого восставал даже его ангельский нрав, и он начинал говорить о необходимости намекнуть Уикхемам, что им пора убираться.</p>
<p>Женитьба Дарси нанесла мисс Бингли глубокую рану, но, так как она сочла полезным сохранить за собой возможность навещать Пемберли, она подавила в душе обиду, еще больше восторгалась Джорджианой, была почти так же, как прежде, внимательна к Дарси и вела себя безукоризненно вежливо по отношению к Элизабет.</p>
<p>Пемберли стал теперь для Джорджианы ее постоянным пристанищем. И между невестками установилась та близость, на какую рассчитывал Дарси. Они даже полюбили друг друга именно так, как когда-то об этом мечтали. Джорджиана продолжала придерживаться самого высокого мнения об Элизабет, хотя поначалу с удивлением, почти близким к испугу, прислушивалась к ее задорной и веселой манере разговаривать с братом. Человек, к которому она всегда питала бесконечное уважение, иногда даже более сильное, чем любовь, теперь нередко оказывался предметом веселых шуток. И она постепенно уразумела то, что ей раньше никогда не приходило в голову. На опыте Элизабет она поняла, что женщина может позволить себе обращаться с мужем так, как не может обращаться с братом младшая сестра.</p>
<p>Женитьба племянника привела леди Кэтрин в крайнее негодование. И, отвечая на письмо о состоявшейся свадьбе, она дала полную волю свойственной ее характеру прямоте. В ответе, таким образом, содержались настолько оскорбительные выражения, в особенности по адресу Элизабет, что на некоторое время всякое общение с Розингсом было прервано. Однако позже Дарси по настоянию Элизабет решил пренебречь чувством обиды и сделал шаг к примирению. После некоторого отпора леди Кэтрин, то ли из-за своей привязанности к племяннику, то ли желая узнать, как себя держит его жена, сменила наконец гнев на милость. И она снизошла до того, что навестила Пемберли, хотя сень его и была осквернена не только присутствием недостойной хозяйки, но также визитами ее дяди и тети из Лондона.</p>
<p>С Гардинерами у них установились самые близкие отношения. Дарси, как и Элизабет, любил их по-настоящему. И оба они навсегда сохранили чувство горячей благодарности к друзьям, которые привезли ее в Дербишир и тем самым способствовали их союзу.</p>

<div class="title4">
<p>КОММЕНТАРИИ</p>
<p>ГОРДОСТЬ И ПРЕДУБЕЖДЕНИЕ</p>
</div>
<p>В записях Кассандры помечено, что первый вариант романа, который назывался «Первые впечатления», создавался между октябрем 1796 года и августом 1797 года, то есть сразу после завершения «Элинор и Марианны». 1 ноября 1797 года отец Джейн Остин, Джордж Остин, отправил письмо издателю Кэделлу, в котором предлагал напечатать «за счет автора или каким-то другим способом рукопись романа в 3-х книгах, объемом, приблизительно равным „Эвелин“ миссис Берни». Предложение Джорджа Остина было отклонено. Больше упоминаний о «Первых впечатлениях» в семейном архиве нет. Окончательный вариант получил название «Гордость и предубеждение». Первоначальный текст романа не сохранился, поэтому трудно сказать, насколько отличается от него последняя редакция.</p>
<p>Причиной изменения заглавия послужило, видимо, то обстоятельство, что в 1801 году в свет вышел роман М. Холфорда под названием «Первые впечатления».</p>
<p>Новое название позаимствовано из романа Фанни Берни «Цецилия» (1782). В пятом томе «Цецилии» один из героев, доктор Листер, так резюмирует мораль романа: «Вся эта грустная история — результат Гордости и Предубеждения. Однако запомните: если горести наши проистекают от Гордости и Предубеждения, то и избавлением от них мы бываем обязаны также Гордости и Предубеждению, ибо так чудесно уравновешены добро и зло в мире».</p>
<p>Возможно, что роман «Гордость и предубеждение» был задуман как пародия на «Цецилию». Во всяком случае, такую возможность допускает известный английский литературовед Ф. Ливис, которая пишет, что «Гордость и предубеждение» — это, безусловно, «реалистический вариант „Цецилии“. Другой крупный специалист по творчеству Остин, Б. Саутем, полагает, что „Гордость и предубеждение“ — пародия на „Сэра Чарлза Грандисона“. Его предположение подкрепляется тем обстоятельством, что в 90-е годы Джейн Остин работала над пародийной драматической версией романа Ричардсона. Дж. Халперин высказывает мнение, что в первоначальной редакции „Гордость и предубеждение“ был по форме романом эпистолярным, то есть написан в жанре, наиболее характерном для „Ювенилий“ Джейн Остин. В общей сложности Остин работала над текстом семнадцать лет.</p>
<p>23 января 1813 года в «Морнинг кроникл» появилось сообщение о выходе в свет «Гордости и предубеждения» в издательстве Т. Эджертона. 27 января Джейн Остин получила первый авторский экземпляр, а 29 января роман появился на прилавках книжных магазинов. На титульном листе значилось: «Гордость и предубеждение». Роман в 3-х книгах автора «Чувства и чувствительности». Стоимость 18 шиллингов».</p>
<p>Право обладания романом, или, как бы теперь сказали, авторские права, Остин продала Эджертону за 110 фунтов, хотя просила 150. Было отпечатано 1500 экземпляров, которые к июлю месяцу оказались распроданы. В ноябре Эджертон принял решение о втором издании, правда, ничего не сказав об этом Джейн Остин. Поэтому она даже не имела возможности исправить ошибки, замеченные в первой публикации. Третьим изданием роман вышел еще при жизни Остин в 1817 году.</p>
<p>В день выхода «Гордости и предубеждения» Джейн Остин писала Кассандре: «Мое любимое дитя прибыло из Лондона», подразумевая три экземпляра книги, присланные ей издателем в Чотэн.</p>
<p>На роман сразу же появились отзывы. Журнал «Британский критик» писал: «Гордость и предубеждение» превосходит все романы такого рода, недавно представленные на суд публики». Особую похвалу анонимного рецензента заслужили образы Элизабет, Дарси, Коллинза. Рецензент из «Критического обозрения» сравнил Элизабет с просвещенными героинями Шекспира и был убежден, что этот персонаж сообщает роману «особое очарование и интерес».</p>
<p>О романе говорили в обществе. На одном обеде Шеридан заметил, что «не читал ничего остроумнее этой книги». Анабелла Милбанк, будущая жена лорда Байрона, в одном из писем назвала роман «самым модным произведением сезона… и самым верным жизни». Сама же Джейн Остин, озадачив многих критиков, особенно XIX в., как-то заметила: «Роман этот слишком легковесен, слишком блестит и сверкает; ему не хватает рельефности: растянуть бы его кое-где с помощью длинной главы, исполненной здравого смысла (да только где его взять!), а не то с помощью серьезной и тяжелой бессмыслицы, никак не связанной с действием, — вставить рассуждение о литературе, критику Вальтера Скотта, историю Буонапарта или еще что-нибудь, что дало бы контраст, после чего читатель с удвоенным восторгом вернулся бы к игривости и эпиграмматичности первоначального стиля».</p>
<p>Но были у нее на этот счет не только иронические суждения. В одном из писем к Кассандре Джейн Остин рассказывает, как она выбирает своих героинь. Большую помощь ей оказывает посещение картинной галереи в Лондоне. Там она нашла портрет, совпавший с образом Джейн Беннет, впоследствии миссис Бингли, который она нарисовала в своем воображении. «Это сама миссис Бингли, до малейших подробностей, рост, прелестное выражение лица. Нет, в самом деле, она удивительно похожа! И одета она в белое платье с зеленой отделкой, что лишний раз убеждает меня в том, что я всегда подозревала: зеленый — ее любимый цвет. Думаю, что миссис Дарси (Элизабет Беннет. — <em>Е. Г.)</em> будет в желтом». В этом же письме она отмечает, что побывала на выставке Дж. Рейнолдса, но портрета Элизабет там не нашла. «Мне остается только думать, что мистер Дарси настолько ценит любое ее изображение, что не захотел выставлять его на обозрение публики. Я полагаю, что у нас тоже было бы подобное чувство — смесь любви, гордости и сдержанности».</p>
<p>Сохранилось несколько высказывании Джейн Остин о работе над стилем романа. Подхватывая слова Вальтера Скотта, сравнившего ее произведения с миниатюрами на слоновой кости, она говорит, что «они не более двух дюймов в ширину, и я пишу на них такой тонкой кистью, что, как ни огромен этот труд, он дает мало эффекта». «Наверное, — добавляет она, — читатель был бы столь же доволен, будь узор менее тонок и закончен… впрочем, художник ничего не может делать неряшливо».</p>
<p>Пейзаж в романе почти отсутствует: несколько строк описания Розингса и Пемберли. Они приводятся писательницей лишь потому, что важны для характеристики психологии Элизабет. Кстати, названия городов и поместий нередко бывают вымышлены, например, Незерфилд-парк, Меритон, Пемберли, Хансфорд, Уэстерхем и др.</p>
<p>Имена некоторых персонажей Джейн Остин стали нарицательными, а фамилия преподобного Коллинза вошла в английский язык как слово, обозначающее высокопарное витиеватое послание.</p>
