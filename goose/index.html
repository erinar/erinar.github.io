THE SNOW GOOSE</h1>
<p id="origchap01">THE GREAT MARSH lies on the Essex coast between the village of Chelmbury and the ancient Saxon oyster-fishing hamlet of Wickaeldroth. It is one of the last of the wild places of England, a low, far-reaching expanse of grass and reeds and half-submerged meadowlands ending in the great saltings and mud flats and tidal pools near the restless sea.</p>
<p>Tidal creeks and estuaries and the crooked, meandering arms of many little rivers whose mouths lap at the edge of the ocean cut through the sodden land that seems to rise and fall and breathe with the recurrence of the daily tides. It is desolate, utterly lonely, and made lonelier by the calls and cries of the wildfowl that make their homes in the marshlands and saltings—the wildgeese and the gulls, the teal and widgeon, the redshanks and curlews that pick their way through the tidal pools. Of human habitants there are none, and none are seen, with the occasional exception of a wild-fowler or native oyster-fishermen, who still ply a trade already ancient when the Normans came to Hastings.</p>
<p>Grays and blues and soft greens are the colors, for when the skies are dark in the long winters, the many waters of the beaches and marshes reflect the cold and somber color. But sometimes, with sunrise and sunset, sky and land are aflame with red and golden fire.</p>
<p>Hard by one of the winding arms of the little River Aelder runs the embankment of an old sea wall, smooth and solid, without a break, a bulwark to the land against the encroaching sea. Deep into a salting some three miles from the North Sea it runs, and there turns north. At that corner its face is gouged, broken, and shattered. It has been breached, and at the breach the hungry sea has already entered and taken for its own the land, the wall, and all that stood there.</p>
<p>At low water the blackened and ruptured stones of the ruins of an abandoned lighthouse show above the surface, with here and there, like buoy markers, the top of a sagging fence-post. Once this lighthouse abutted on the sea and was a beacon on the Essex coast. Time shifted land and water, and its usefulness came to an end.</p>
<p>Lately it served again as a human habitation. In it there lived a lonely man. His body was warped, but his heart was filled with love for wild and hunted things. He was ugly to look upon, but he created great beauty. It is about him, and a child who came to know him and see beyond the grotesque form that housed him to what lay within, that this story is told.</p>
<p>It is not a story that falls easily and smoothly into sequence. It has been garnered from many sources and from many people. Some of it comes in the form of fragments from men who looked upon strange and violent scenes. For the sea has claimed its own and spreads its rippled blanket over the site, and the great white bird with the black-tipped pinions that saw it all from the beginning to the end has returned to the dark, frozen silences of the northlands whence it came.</p>
<p id="origchap02">IN THE late spring of 1930 Philip Rhayader came to the abandoned lighthouse at the mouth of the Aelder. He bought the light and many acres of marshland and salting surrounding it.</p>
<p>He lived and worked there alone the year round. He was a painter of birds and of nature, who, for reasons, had withdrawn from all human society. Some of the reasons were apparent on his fortnightly visits to the little village of Chelmbury for supplies, where the natives looked askance at his mis-shapen body and dark visage. For he was a hunchback and his left arm was crippled, thin and bent at the wrist, like the claw of a bird.</p>
<p>They soon became used to his queer figure, small but powerful, the massive, dark, bearded head set just slightly below the mysterious mound on his back, the glowing eyes and the clawed hand, and marked him off as “that queer painter chap that lives down to lighthouse.”</p>
<p>Physical deformity often breeds hatred of humanity in men. Rhayader did not hate; he loved very greatly, man, the animal kingdom, and all nature. His heart was filled with pity and understanding. He had mastered his handicap, but he could not master the rebuffs he suffered, due to his appearance. The thing that drove him into seclusion was his failure to find anywhere a return of the warmth that flowed from him. He repelled women. Men would have warmed to him had they got to know him. But the mere fact that an effort was being made hurt Rhayader and drove him to avoid the person making it.</p>
<p>He was twenty-seven when he came to the Great Marsh. He had traveled much and fought valiantly before he made the decision to withdraw from a world in which he could not take part as other men. For all of the artist’s sensitivity and woman’s tenderness locked in his barrel breast, he was very much a man.</p>
<p>In his retreat he had his birds, his painting, and his boat. He owned a sixteen-footer, which he sailed with wonderful skill. Alone, with no eyes to watch him, he managed well with his deformed hand, and he often used his strong teeth to handle the sheets of his billowing sails in a tricky blow.</p>
<p>He would sail the tidal creeks and estuaries and out to sea, and would be gone for days at a time, looking for new species of birds to photograph or sketch, and he became an adept at netting them to add to his collection of tamed wildfowl in the pen near his studio that formed the nucleus of a sanctuary.</p>
<p>He never shot over a bird, and wild-fowlers were not welcome near his premises. He was a friend to all things wild, and the wild things repaid him with their friendship.</p>
<p>Tamed in his enclosures were the geese that came winging down the coast from Iceland and Spitsbergen each October, in great skeins that darkened the sky and filled the air with the rushing noise of their passage—the brown-bodied pink-feet, white-breasted barnacles with their dark necks and clowns’ masks, the wild white fronts with black-barred breasts, and many species of wild ducks—widgeon, mallard, pintails, teal, and shovelers.</p>
<p>Some were pinioned, so that they would remain there as a sign and signal to the wild ones that came down at each winter’s beginning that here were food and sanctuary.</p>
<p>Many hundreds came and remained with him all through the cold weather from October to the early spring, when they migrated north again to their breeding-grounds below the ice rim.</p>
<p>Rhayader was content in the knowledge that when storms blew, or it was bitter cold and food was scarce, or the big punt guns of the distant bag hunters roared, his birds were safe; that he had gathered to the sanctuary and security of his own arms and heart these many wild and beautiful creatures who knew and trusted him.</p>
<p>They would answer the call of the north in the spring, but in the fall they would come back, barking and whooping and honking in the autumn sky, to circle the landmark of the old light and drop to earth near by to be his guests again—birds that he well remembered and recognized from the previous year.</p>
<p>And this made Rhayader happy, because he knew that implanted somewhere in their beings was the germ knowledge of his existence and his safe haven, that this knowledge had become a part of them and, with the coming of the gray skies and the winds from the north, would send them un-erringly back to him.</p>
<p>For the rest, his heart and soul went into the painting of the country in which he lived and its creatures. There are not many Rhayaders extant. He hoarded them jealously, piling them up in his lighthouse and the storerooms above by the hundreds. He was not satisfied with them, because as an artist he was uncompromising.</p>
<p>But the few that have reached the market are masterpieces, filled with the glow and colors of marsh-reflected light, the feel of flight, the push of birds breasting a morning wind bending the tall flag reeds. He painted the loneliness and the smell of the salt-laden cold, the eternity and agelessness of marshes, the wild, living creatures, dawn flights, and frightened things taking to the air, and winged shadows at night hiding from the moon.</p>
<p id="origchap03">ONE November afternoon, three years after Rhayader had come to the Great Marsh, a child approached the lighthouse studio by means of the sea wall. In her arms she carried a burden.</p>
<p>She was no more than twelve, slender, dirty, nervous and timid as a bird, but beneath the grime as eerily beautiful as a marsh faery. She was pure Saxon, large-boned, fair, with a head to which her body was yet to grow, and deep-set, violet-colored eyes.</p>
<p>She was desperately frightened of the ugly man she had come to see, for legend had already begun to gather about Rhayader, and the native wild-fowlers hated him for interfering with their sport.</p>
<p>But greater than her fear was the need of that which she bore. For locked in her child’s heart was the knowledge, picked up somewhere in the swampland, that this ogre who lived in the lighthouse had magic that could heal injured things.</p>
<p>She had never seen Rhayader before and was close to fleeing in panic at the dark apparition that appeared at the studio door, drawn by her footsteps—the black head and beard, the sinister hump, and the crooked claw.</p>
<p>She stood there staring, poised like a disturbed marsh bird for instant flight.</p>
<p>But his voice was deep and kind when he spoke to her.</p>
<p>“What is it, child?”</p>
<p>She stood her ground, and then edged timidly forward. The thing she carried in her arms was a large white bird, and it was quite still. There were stains of blood on its whiteness and on her kirtle where she had held it to her.</p>
<p>The girl placed it in his arms. “I found it, sir. It’s hurted. Is it still alive?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I think so. Come in, child, come in.”</p>
<p>Rhayader went inside, bearing the bird, which he placed upon a table, where it moved feebly. Curiosity overcame fear. The girl followed and found herself in a room warmed by a coal fire, shining with many colored pictures that covered the walls, and full of a strange but pleasant smell.</p>
<p>The bird fluttered. With his good hand Rhayader spread one of its immense white pinions. The end was beautifully tipped with black.</p>
<p>Rhayader looked and marveled, and said: “Child, where did you find it?”</p>
<p>“In t’ marsh, sir, where fowlers had been. What—what is it, sir?”</p>
<p>“It’s a snow goose from Canada. But how in all heaven came it here?”</p>
<p>The name seemed to mean nothing to the little girl. Her deep violet eyes, shining out of the dirt on her thin face, were fixed with concern on the injured bird.</p>
<p>She said: “Can ’ee heal it, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” said Rhayader. “We will try. Come, you shall help me.”</p>
<p>There were scissors and bandages and splints on a shelf, and he was marvelously deft, even with the crooked claw that managed to hold things.</p>
<p>He said: “Ah, she has been shot, poor thing. Her leg is broken, and the wing tip, but not badly. See, we will clip her primaries, so that we can bandage it, but in the spring the feathers will grow and she will be able to fly again. We’ll bandage it close to her body, so that she cannot move it until it has set, and then make a splint for the poor leg.”</p>
<p>Her fears forgotten, the child watched, fascinated, as he worked, and all the more so because while he fixed a fine splint to the shattered leg he told her the most wonderful story.</p>
<p>The bird was a young one, no more than a year old. She was born in a northern land far, far across the seas, a land belonging to England. Flying to the south to escape the snow and ice and bitter cold, a great storm had seized her and whirled and buffeted her about. It was a truly terrible storm, stronger than her great wings, stronger than anything. For days and nights it held her in its grip and there was nothing she could do but fly before it. When finally it had blown itself out and her sure instincts took her south again, she was over a different land and surrounded by strange birds that she had never seen before. At last, exhausted by her ordeal, she had sunk to rest in a friendly green marsh, only to be met by the blast from the hunter’s gun.</p>
<p>“A bitter reception for a visiting princess,” concluded Rhayader. “We will call her ‘La Princesse Perdue,’ the Lost Princess. And in a few days she will be feeling much better. See?” He reached into his pocket and produced a handful of grain. The snow goose opened its round yellow eyes and nibbled at it.</p>
<p>The child laughed with delight, and then suddenly caught her breath with alarm as the full import of where she was pressed in upon her, and without a word she turned and fled out of the door.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait!” cried Rhayader, and went to the entrance, where he stopped so that it framed his dark bulk. The girl was already fleeing down the sea wall, but she paused at his voice and looked back.</p>
<p>“What is your name, child?”</p>
<p>“Frith.”</p>
<p>“Eh?” said Rhayader. “Fritha, I suppose. Where do you live?”</p>
<p>“Wi’ t’ fisherfolk at Wickaeldroth.” She gave the name the old Saxon pronunciation.</p>
<p>“Will you come back tomorrow, or the next day, to see how the Princess is getting along?”</p>
<p>She paused, and again Rhayader must have thought of the wild water birds caught motionless in that split second of alarm before they took to flight.</p>
<p>But her thin voice came back to him: “Ay!”</p>
<p>And then she was gone, with her fair hair streaming out behind her.</p>
<p>The snow goose mended rapidly and by midwinter was already limping about the enclosure with the wild pink-footed geese with which it associated, rather than the barnacles, and had learned to come to be fed at Rhayader’s call. And the child, Fritha, or Frith, was a frequent visitor. She had overcome her fear of Rhayader. Her imagination was captured by the presence of this strange white princess from a land far over the sea, a land that was all pink, as she knew from the map that Rhayader showed her, and on which they traced the stormy path of the lost bird from its home in Canada to the Great Marsh of Essex.</p>
<p>Then one June morning a group of late pink-feet, fat and well fed from the winter at the lighthouse, answered the stronger call of the breeding-grounds and rose lazily, climbing into the sky in ever widening circles. With them, her white body and black-tipped pinions shining in the spring sun, was the snow goose. It so happened that Frith was at the lighthouse. Her cry brought Rhayader running from the studio.</p>
<p>“Look! Look! The Princess! Be she going away?”</p>
<p>Rhayader stared into the sky at the climbing specks. “Ay,” he said, unconsciously dropping into her manner of speech. “The Princess is going home. Listen! She is bidding us farewell.”</p>
<p>Out of the clear sky came the mournful barking of the pink-feet, and above it the higher, clearer note of the snow goose. The specks drifted northward, formed into a tiny <strong>v</strong>, diminished, and vanished.</p>
<p>With the departure of the snow goose ended the visits of Frith to the lighthouse. Rhayader learned all over again the meaning of the word “loneliness.” That summer, out of his memory, he painted a picture of a slender, grime-covered child, her fair hair blown by a November storm, who bore in her arms a wounded white bird.</p>
<p id="origchap04">IN mid-October the miracle occurred. Rhayader was in his enclosure, feeding his birds. A gray northeast wind was blowing and the land was sighing beneath the incoming tide. Above the sea and the wind noises he heard a clear, high note. He turned his eyes upward to the evening sky in time to see first an infinite speck, then a black-and-white-pinioned dream that circled the lighthouse once, and finally a reality that dropped to earth in the pen and came waddling forward importantly to be fed, as though she had never been away. It was the snow goose. There was no mistaking her. Tears of joy came to Rhayader’s eyes. Where had she been? Surely not home to Canada. No, she must have summered in Greenland or Spitsbergen with the pink-feet. She had remembered and had returned.</p>
<p>When next Rhayader went in to Chelmbury for supplies, he left a message with the postmistress—one that must have caused her much bewilderment. He said: “Tell Frith, who lives with the fisherfolk at Wickaeldroth, that the Lost Princess has returned.”</p>
<p>Three days later, Frith, taller, still tousled and unkempt, came shyly to the lighthouse to visit La Princesse Perdue.</p>
<p>Time passed. On the Great Marsh it was marked by the height of the tides, the slow march of the seasons, the passage of the birds, and, for Rhayader, by the arrival and departure of the snow goose.</p>
<p>The world outside boiled and seethed and rumbled with the eruption that was soon to break forth and come close to marking its destruction. But not yet did it touch upon Rhayader, or, for that matter, Frith. They had fallen into a curious, natural rhythm, even as the child grew older. When the snow goose was at the lighthouse, then she came, too, to visit and learn many things from Rhayader. They sailed together in his speedy boat, that he handled so skillfully. They caught wildfowl for the ever increasing colony, and built new pens and enclosures for them. From him she learned the lore of every wild bird, from gull to gyrfalcon, that flew the marshes. She cooked for him sometimes, and even learned to mix his paints.</p>
<p>But when the snow goose returned to its summer home, it was as though some kind of bar was up between them, and she did not come to the lighthouse. One year the bird did not return, and Rhayader was heartbroken. All things seemed to have ended for him. He painted furiously through the winter and the next summer, and never once saw the child. But in the fall the familiar cry once more rang from the sky, and the huge white bird, now at its full growth, dropped from the skies as mysteriously as it had departed. Joyously, Rhayader sailed his boat into Chelmbury and left his message with the postmistress.</p>
<p>Curiously, it was more than a month after he had left the message before Frith reappeared at the lighthouse, and Rhayader, with a shock, realized that she was a child no longer.</p>
<p>After the year in which the bird had remained away, its periods of absence grew shorter and shorter. It had grown so tame that it followed Rhayader about and even came into the studio while he was working.</p>
<p id="origchap05">IN THE SPRING of 1940 the birds migrated early from the Great Marsh. The world was on fire. The whine and roar of the bombers and the thudding explosions frightened them. The first day of May, Frith and Rhayader stood shoulder to shoulder on the sea wall and watched the last of the unpinioned pink-feet and barnacle geese rise from their sanctuary; she, tall, slender, free as air, and hauntingly beautiful; he, dark, grotesque, his massive bearded head raised to the sky, his glowing dark eyes watching the geese form their flight tracery.</p>
<p>“Look, Philip,” Frith said.</p>
<p>Rhayader followed her eyes. The snow goose had taken flight, her giant wings spread, but she was flying low, and once came quite close to them, so that for a moment the spreading black-tipped, white pinions seemed to caress them and they felt the rush of the bird’s swift passage. Once, twice, she circled the lighthouse, then dropped to earth again in the enclosure with the pinioned geese and commenced to feed.</p>
<p>“She be’ent going,” said Frith, with marvel in her voice. The bird in its close passage seemed to have woven a kind of magic about her. “The Princess be goin’ t’ stay.”</p>
<p>“Ay,” said Rhayader, and his voice was shaken too. “She’ll stay. She will never go away again. The Lost Princess is lost no more. This is her home now—of her own free will.”</p>
<p>The spell the bird had girt about her was broken, and Frith was suddenly conscious of the fact that she was frightened, and the things that frightened her were in Rhayader’s eyes—the longing and the loneliness and the deep, welling, unspoken things that lay in and behind them as he turned them upon her.</p>
<p>His last words were repeating themselves in her head as though he had said them again: “This is her home now—of her own free will.” The delicate tendrils of her instincts reached to him and carried to her the message of the things he could not speak because of what he felt himself to be, mis-shapen and grotesque. And where his voice might have soothed her, her fright grew greater at his silence and the power of the unspoken things between them. The woman in her bade her take flight from something that she was not yet capable of understanding.</p>
<p>Frith said: “I—I must go. Good-by. I be glad the—the Princess will stay. You’ll not be so alone now.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked swiftly away, and his sadly spoken “Good-by, Frith,” was only a half-heard ghost of a sound borne to her ears above the rustling of the marsh grass. She was far away before she dared turn for a backward glance. He was still standing on the sea wall, a dark speck against the sky.</p>
<p>Her fear had stilled now. It had been replaced by something else, a queer sense of loss that made her stand quite still for a moment, so sharp was it. Then, more slowly, she continued on, away from the skyward-pointing finger of the lighthouse and the man beneath it.</p>
<p id="origchap06">IT WAS a little more than three weeks before Frith returned to the lighthouse. May was at its end, and the day, too, in a long golden twilight that was giving way to the silver of the moon already hanging in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>She told herself, as her steps took her thither, that she must know whether the snow goose had really stayed, as Rhayader said it would. Perhaps it had flown away, after all. But her firm tread on the sea wall was full of eagerness, and sometimes unconsciously she found herself hurrying.</p>
<p>Frith saw the yellow light of Rhayader’s lantern down by his little wharf, and she found him there. His sailboat was rocking gently on a flooding tide and he was loading supplies into her—water and food and bottles of brandy, gear and a spare sail. When he turned to the sound of her coming, she saw that he was pale, but that his dark eyes, usually so kind and placid, were glowing with excitement, and he was breathing heavily from his exertions.</p>
<p>Sudden alarm seized Frith. The snow goose was forgotten. “Philip! Ye be goin’ away?”</p>
<p>Rhayader paused in his work to greet her, and there was something in his face, a glow and a look, that she had never seen there before.</p>
<p>“Frith! I am glad you came. Yes, I must go away. A little trip. I will come back.” His usually kindly voice was hoarse with what was suppressed inside him.</p>
<p>Frith asked: “Where must ye go?”</p>
<p>Words came tumbling from Rhayader now. He must go to Dunkirk. A hundred miles across the North Sea. A British army was trapped there on the sands, awaiting destruction at the hands of the advancing Germans. The port was in flames, the position hopeless. He had heard it in the village when he had gone for supplies. Men were putting out from Chelmbury in answer to the government’s call, every tug and fishing boat or power launch that could propel itself was heading across the sea to haul the men off the beaches to the transports and destroyers that could not reach the shallows, to rescue as many as possible from the Germans’ fire.</p>
<p>Frith listened and felt her heart dying within her. He was saying that he would cross the sea in his little boat. It could take six men at a time; in a pinch, seven. He could make many trips from the beaches to the transports.</p>
<p>The girl was young, primitive, inarticulate. She did not understand war, or what had happened in France, or the meaning of the trapped army, but the blood within her told her that here was danger.</p>
<p>“Philip! Must ’ee go? You’ll not come back. Why must it be ’ee?”</p>
<p>The fever seemed to have gone from Rhayader’s soul with the first rush of words, and he explained it to her in terms that she could understand.</p>
<p>He said: “Men are huddled on the beaches like hunted birds, Frith, like the wounded and hunted birds we used to find and bring to sanctuary. Over them fly the steel peregrines, hawks and gyrfalcons, and they have no shelter from these iron birds of prey. They are lost and storm-driven and harried, like the Princesse Perdue you found and brought to me out of the marshes many years ago, and we healed her. They need help, my dear, as our wild creatures have needed help, and that is why I must go. It is something that I can do. Yes, I can. For once—for once I can be a man and play my part.”</p>
<p>Frith stared at Rhayader. He had changed so. For the first time she saw that he was no longer ugly or mis-shapen or grotesque, but very beautiful. Things were turmoiling in her own soul, crying to be said, and she did not know how to say them.</p>
<p>“I’ll come with ’ee, Philip.”</p>
<p>Rhayader shook his head. “Your place in the boat would cause a soldier to be left behind, and another and another. I must go alone.”</p>
<p>He donned rubber coat and boots and took to his boat. He waved and called back: “Good-by! Will you look after the birds until I return, Frith?”</p>
<p>Frith’s hand came up, but only half, to wave too. “God speed you,” she said, but gave it the Saxon turn. “I will take care of t’ birds. Godspeed, Philip.”</p>
<p>It was night now, bright with moon fragment and stars and northern glow. Frith stood on the sea wall and watched the sail gliding down the swollen estuary. Suddenly from the darkness behind her there came a rush of wings, and something swept past her into the air. In the night light she saw the flash of white wings, black-tipped, and the thrust-forward head of the snow goose.</p>
<p>It rose and cruised over the lighthouse once and then headed down the winding creek where Rhayader’s sail was slanting in the gaining breeze, and flew above him in slow, wide circles.</p>
<p>White sail and white bird were visible for a long time.</p>
<p>“Watch o’er him. Watch o’er him,” Fritha whispered. When they were both out of sight at last, she turned and walked slowly, with bent head, back to the empty lighthouse.</p>
<p id="origchap07">NOW the story becomes fragmentary, and one of these fragments is in the words of the men on leave who told it in the public room of the Crown and Arrow, an East Chapel pub.</p>
<p>“A goose, a bloomin’ goose, so ’elp me,” said Private Potton, of His Majesty’s London Rifles.</p>
<p>“Garn,” said a bandy-legged artilleryman.</p>
<p>“A goose it was. Jock, ’ere, seed it same as me. It come flyin’ down outa the muck an’ stink an’ smoke of Dunkirk that was over’ead. It was white, wiv black on its wings, an’ it circles us like a bloomin’ dive bomber. Jock, ’ere, ’e sez: ‘We’re done for. It’s the hangel of death a-come for us.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Garn,’ Hi sez, ‘it’s a ruddy goose, come over from ’ome wiv a message from Churchill, an’ ’ow are we henjoying the bloomin’ bathing, It’s a omen, that’s what it is, a bloody omen. We’ll get out of this yet, me lad.’</p>
<p>“We was roostin’ on the beach between Dunkirk an’ Lapanny, like a lot o’ bloomin’ pigeons on Victoria Hembankment, waitin’ for Jerry to pot us. ’E potted us good too. ’E was be’ind us an’ flankin’ us an’ above us. ’E give us shrapnel and ’e give us H. E., an’ ’e peppers us from the bloomin’ hatmosphere with Jittersmiths.</p>
<p>“An’ offshore is the Kentish Maid, a ruddy hexcursion scow wot Hi’ve taken many a trip on out of Margate in the summer, for two-and-six, waiting to take us off, ‘arf a mile out from the bloomin’ shallows.</p>
<p>“While we are lyin’ there on the beach, done in an’ cursin’ becos there ain’t no way to get out to the boat, a Stuka dives on’er, an’ ’is bombs drop alongside of ’er, throwin’ up water like the bloomin’ fountains in the palace gardens; a reg’lar display it was.</p>
<p>“Then a destroyer come up an’ says: ‘No, ye don’t,’ to the Stuka with ack-acks and pom-poms, but another Jerry dives on the destroyer, an’ ’its ’er. Coo, did she go up! She burned before she sunk, an’ the smoke an’ the stink come driftin’ inshore, all yellow an’ black, an’ out of it comes this bloomin’ goose, a-circlin’ around us trapped on the beach.</p>
<p>“An’ then around a bend ’e comes in a bloody little sailboat, sailing along as cool as you please, like a bloomin’ toff out for a pleasure spin on a Sunday hafternoon at ’Enley.”</p>
<p>“ ’Oo comes?” inquired a civilian.</p>
<p>“ ’Im! ’Im that saved a lot of us. ’E sailed clean through a boil of machine-gun bullets from a Jerry in a Jittersmith wot was strafin’—a Rams-gate motorboat wot ’ad tried to take us off ’ad been sunk there ’arf an hour ago—the water was all frothin’ with shell splashes an’ bullets, but ’e didn’t give it no mind, ’e didn’t ’E didn’t ’ave no petrol to burn or hexplode, an’ he sailed in between the shells.</p>
<p>“Into the shallows ’e come out of the black smoke of the burnin’ destroyer, a little dark man wiv a beard, a bloomin’ claw for a ’and, an’ a ’ump on ’is back.</p>
<p>“ ’E ’ad a rope in ’is teeth that was shinin’ white out of ’is black beard, ’is good ’and on the tiller an’ the crooked one beckonin’ to us to come. An’ over’ ead, around and around, flies the ruddy goose.</p>
<p>“Jock, ’ere, says: ‘Lawk, it’s all over now. It’s the bloody devil come for us ’imself. Hi must ’ave been struck an’ don’t know it.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Garn,’ I sez, ‘it’s more like the good Lord, ’e looks to me, than any bloomin’ devil.’ ’E did, too, like the pictures from the Sunday-school books, wiv ’is white face and dark eyes an’ beard an’ all, and ’is bloomin’ boat.</p>
<p>“ ‘Hi can take seven at a time,’ ’e sings out when ’e’s in close.</p>
<p>“Our horfficer shouts: ‘Good, man! … You seven nearest, get in.’</p>
<p>“We waded out to where ’e was. Hi was that weary Hi couldn’t clumb over the side, but ’e takes me by the collar of me tunic an’ pulls, wiv a ‘In ye go, lad. Come on. Next man.’</p>
<p>“An’ in Hi went. Coo, ’e was strong, ’e was. Then ’e sets ’is sail, part of wot looks like a bloomin’ sieve from machine-gun bullets, shouts: ‘Keep down in the bottom of the boat, boys, in case we meet any of yer friends,’ and we’re off, ’im sittin’ in the stern wiv ’is rope in ’is teeth, another in ’is crooked claw, an’ ’is right ’and on the tiller, a-steerin’ an’ sailin’ through the spray of the shells thrown by a land battery somewhere back of the coast. An’ the bloomin’ goose is flyin’ around and around, ’onking above the wind and the row Jerry was makin’, like a bloomin’ Morris autermobile on Winchester by-pass.</p>
<p>“ ‘Hi told you yon goose was a omen,’ Hi sez to Jock. ‘Look at ’im there, a bloomin’ hangel of mercy.’</p>
<p>“ ’Im at the tiller just looks up at the goose, wiv the rope in ’is teeth, an’ grins at ’er like ’e knows ’er a lifetime.</p>
<p>“ ’E brung us out to the Kentish Maid and turns around and goes back for another load. ’E made trips all afternoon an’ all night, too, because the bloody light of Dunkirk burning was bright enough to see by. Hi don’t know ’ow many trips ’e made, but ’im an’ a nobby Thames Yacht Club motorboat an’ a big lifeboat from Poole that come along brought off all there was of us on that particular stretch of hell, without the loss of a man.</p>
<p>“We sailed when the last man was off, an’ there was more than seven hunder’ of us haboard a boat built to take two hunder’. ’E was still there when we left, an’ ’e waved us good-by and sails off toward Dunkirk, and the bird wiv ’im. Blyme, it was queer to see that ruddy big goose flyin’ around ’is boat, lit up by the fires like a white hangel against the smoke.</p>
<p>“A Stuka ’ad another go at us, ’arfway across, but ’e’d been stayin’ up late nights, an’ missed. By mornin’ we was safe ’ome.</p>
<p>“Hi never did find out what become of ’im, or ’oo ’e was—’im wiv the ’ump an’ ’is little sailboat. A bloody good man ’e was, that chap.”</p>
<p>“Coo,” said the artilleryman. “A ruddy big goose. Whatcher know?”</p>
<p id="origchap08">IN AN officers’ club on Brook Street, a retired naval officer, sixty-five years old, Commander Keith Brill-Oudener, was telling of his experiences during the evacuation of Dunkirk. Called out of bed at four o’clock in the morning, he had captained a lopsided Limehouse tug across the Strait of Dover, towing a string of Thames barges, which he brought back four times loaded with soldiers. On his last trip he came in with her funnel shot away and a hole in her side. But he got her back to Dover.</p>
<p>A naval-reserve officer, who had two Brixham trawlers and a Yarmouth drifter blasted out from under him in the last four days of the evacuation, said: “Did you run across that queer sort of legend about a wild goose? It was all up and down the beaches. You know how those things spring up. Some of the men I brought back were talking about it. It was supposed to have appeared at intervals the last days between Dunkirk and La Panne. If you saw it, you were eventually saved. That sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“H’m’m’m,” said Brill-Oudener, “a wild goose. I saw a tame one. Dashed strange experience. Tragic, in a way, too. And lucky for us. Tell you about it. Third trip back. Toward six o’clock we sighted a derelict small boat. Seemed to be a chap or a body in her. And a bird perched on the rail.</p>
<p>“We changed our course when we got nearer, and went over for a look-see. By Gad, it was a chap. Or had been, poor fellow. Machine-gunned, you know. Badly. Face down in the water. Bird was a goose, a tame one.</p>
<p>“We drifted close, but when one of our chaps reached over, the bird hissed at him and struck at him with her wings. Couldn’t drive it off. Suddenly young Kettering, who was with me, gave a hail and pointed to starboard. Big mine floating by. One of Jerry’s beauties, If we’d kept on our course we’d have piled right into it. Ugh! Head on. We let it get a hundred yards astern of the last barge, and the men blew it up with rifle-fire.</p>
<p>“When we turned our attention to the derelict again, she was gone. Sunk. Concussion, you know. Chap with her. He must have been lashed to her. The bird had got up and was circling. Three times, like a plane saluting. Dashed queer feeling. Then she flew off to the west. Lucky thing for us we went over to have a look, eh? Odd that you should mention a goose.”</p>
<p id="origchap09">FRITHA REMAINED alone at the little lighthouse on the Great Marsh, taking care of the pinioned birds, waiting for she knew not what. The first days she haunted the sea wall, watching; though she knew it was useless. Later she roamed through the storerooms of the lighthouse building with their stacks of canvases on which Rhayader had captured every mood and light of the desolate country and the wondrous, graceful, feathered things that inhabited it.</p>
<p>Among them she found the picture that Rhayader had painted of her from memory so many years ago, when she was still a child, and had stood, wind-blown and timid, at his threshold, hugging an injured bird to her.</p>
<p>The picture and the things she saw in it stirred her as nothing ever had before, for much of Rhayader’s soul had gone into it. Strangely, it was the only time he had painted the snow goose, the lost wild creature, storm-driven from another land, that to each had brought a friend, and which, in the end, returned to her with the message that she would never see him again.</p>
<p>Long before the snow goose had come dropping out of a crimsoned eastern sky to circle the lighthouse in a last farewell, Fritha, from the ancient powers of the blood that was in her, knew that Rhayader would not return.</p>
<p>And so, when one sunset she heard the high-pitched, well-remembered note cried from the heavens, it brought no instant of false hope to her heart. This moment, it seemed, she had lived before many times.</p>
<p>She came running to the sea wall and turned her eyes, not toward the distant sea whence a sail might come, but to the sky from whose flaming arches plummeted the snow goose. Then the sight, the sound, and the solitude surrounding broke the dam within her and released the surging, overwhelming truth of her love, let it well forth in tears.</p>
<p>Wild spirit called to wild spirit, and she seemed to be flying with the great bird, soaring with it in the evening sky, and hearkening to Rhayader’s message.</p>
<p>Sky and earth were trembling with it and filled her beyond the bearing of it. “Frith! Fritha! Frith, my love. Good-by, my love.” The white pinions, black-tipped, were beating it out upon her heart, and her heart was answering: “Philip, I love ’ee.”</p>
<p>For a moment Frith thought the snow goose was going to land in the old enclosure, as the pinioned geese set up a welcoming gabble. But it only skimmed low, then soared up again, flew in a wide, graceful spiral once around the old light, and then began to climb.</p>
<p>Watching it, Frith saw no longer the snow goose but the soul of Rhayader taking farewell of her before departing forever.</p>
<p>She was no longer flying with it, but earth-bound. She stretched her arms up into the sky and stood on tiptoes, reaching, and cried: “Godspeed! Godspeed, Philip!”</p>
<p>Frith’s tears were stilled. She stood watching silently long after the goose had vanished. Then she went into the lighthouse and secured the picture that Rhayader had painted of her. Hugging it to her breast, she wended her way homeward along the old sea wall.</p>
<p id="origchap10">EACH NIGHT, for many weeks thereafter, Frith came to the lighthouse and fed the pinioned birds. Then one early morning a German pilot on a dawn raid mistook the old abandoned light for an active military objective, dived onto it, a screaming steel hawk, and blew it and all it contained into oblivion.</p>
<p>That evening when Fritha came, the sea had moved in through the breached walls and covered it over. Nothing was left to break the utter desolation. No marsh fowl had dared to return. Only the frightless gulls wheeled and soared and mewed their plaint over the place where it had been.</p>

СНЕЖНЫЙ ГУСЬ</h1>
<section>
<p id="transchap01">Большая Топь протянулась вдоль эссекского побережья между деревней Челмбери и старинным саксонским селением Уикельдрот, жители которого издавна промышляют сбором устриц. Это один из последних диких уголков Англии — широкая низменность, заросшая травой, камышами, занятая полузатопленными луговинами и переходящая, ближе к беспокойному морю, в солончаки, илистые отмели и приливно-отливные заводи.</p>
<p>Кажется, вся эта пропитанная влагой земля, с ее непостоянными заводями, эстуариями, кривыми извилистыми рукавами маленьких речек, чьи устья сливаются в одно у края океана, сама поднимается, опускается, дышит, подчиняясь ежедневному ритму приливов и отливов. Пустынная, она кажется еще более одинокой от криков и стонов диких птиц, селящихся на солончаках и болотах — гусей, чаек, чирков, травников, кроншнепов, чьи пути неизменно пролегают через эти места. Люди тут не живут — лишь изредка можно увидать какого-нибудь охотника за пернатой дичью или сборщика устриц, продолжающих древний промысел своих предков, известный здесь задолго до того, как норманы пришли в Гастингс.</p>
<p>Цветовая гамма тут состоит из различных оттенков серого, голубого и приглушенно-зеленого — так холодный сдержанный цвет неба отражается во время долгих зим множеством береговых вод и болотами. Но иногда на рассвете или в часы заката земля и небо бывают озарены золотым и красным огнем. Неподалеку от одного из извилистых рукавов маленькой речки Элдер протянулась стена старой дамбы, мощная, гладкая, без единой бреши, надежный оплот земли против наступающего моря. На добрых три мили уходит она от Северного моря в глубь солончака и там поворачивает на север. С этой стороны вид у нее обветшалый и разбитый. В одном месте образовалась брешь, и голодное море устремилось в нее, завладев частью земли, дамбой и всем, что там находилось.</p>
<p>Во время отлива над поверхностью воды виднеются почерневшие камни развалин покинутого маяка и кое-где, подобно бакенам, выглядывают покосившиеся столбы ограды. Когда-то маяк этот стоял у самого края моря и был путеводной звездой эссекского побережья. Время сместило границу моря и суши — и он сделался ненужным.</p>
<p>Но потом, уже сравнительно недавно, к нему опять вернулась жизнь. В стенах его поселился одинокий человек. Тело его было ущербным, но сердце полнилось любовью ко всем диким и гонимым существам. С виду он был некрасив, даже уродлив, зато умел творить настоящую красоту. О нем-то и о девочке, которой довелось познакомиться с ним и разглядеть за пугающей оболочкой то, что было скрыто внутри, пойдет речь в этой истории.</p>
<p>Повествование это не может быть гладким. Чтобы установить последовательность событий, приходилось обращаться к разным людям и источникам. Где-то оно складывается из не вполне связных рассказов людей, ставших очевидцами странных, потрясающих воображенье сцен. Потому что море, получив свое, простерло надо всем волнистый покров, а большая белая птица с черной каймой на крыльях, знающая эту историю от начала и до конца, вернулась к темному ледяному безмолвию того северного края, из которого появилась.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap02">Филипп Раедер пришел на заброшенный маяк в устье реки Элдер поздней весной 1930 года. Выкупил маяк с окружавшими его солончаками и болотами и поселился в нём.</p>
<p>Здесь он жил круглый год в одиночестве, занимаясь любимым делом. Художник, он писал птиц и окрестности. У него было достаточно причин удалиться от людей. Причины эти, или по крайней мере, некоторые из них, были вполне очевидны. Раз в три недели он отправлялся за продуктами в маленькую деревушку Челмбери, где жители с подозрением вглядывались в его странное темное лицо и уродливую фигуру. Он был горбун; левая рука скрюченная, совсем тонкая и вывернута в запястье наподобие птичьей лапы.</p>
<p>Они скоро привыкли к его несуразной фигуре, маленькой, но мощной (тяжелая, темная, лохматая голова, посаженная чуть ниже таинственного бугра за плечами, сверкающие глаза и скрюченная рука), и уже с небрежностью отзывались о нем как о «том чудаке, что малюет на маяке картины».</p>
<p>Бывает, физическое уродство озлобляет человека. Раедер не озлобился; он любил, и любил по-настоящему — людей, животных, всю природу. Сердце его было полно жалости и сочувствия. Сам он давно перестал замечать свое уродство, но по-прежнему болезненно воспринимал грубость и насмешки, которым подвергался из-за своей внешности. Излучаемая им доброта никогда не находила отклика, что и побудило его к затворничеству. У женщин он вызывал отвращение. Мужчины могли бы проникнуться к нему дружеским чувством, если бы узнали поближе. Но видя, что собеседник делает над собой усилие, Раедер смущался и в дальнейшем старался избегать общения.</p>
<p>Когда он пришел на Большую Топь, ему было двадцать семь. Он уже много путешествовал и прошел немало испытаний, прежде чем принял решение удалиться от мира, где для него в отличие от других мужчин, так и не нашлось места. При всей чуткости художника и почти женской нежности, запертых в его бочкообразной грудной клетке, он оставался прежде всего мужчиной.</p>
<p>В его уединении с ним были птицы, живопись и лодка. Это была шестнадцатифутовая парусная лодка, которой он управлял с удивительной ловкостью. Один, без посторонних глаз, он уверенно действовал скрюченной рукой и нередко прибегал к помощи зубов, чтобы совладать с рвущимися парусами при каком-нибудь коварном порыве ветра.</p>
<p>В этой лодке он плавал по заливам, эстуариям, выходил в море и, бывало, пропадал по нескольку дней в поисках новых видов птиц — фотографировал, делал наброски, иногда ловил силками, пополняя свою коллекцию: огороженная площадка неподалеку от его студии уже сделалась центром птичьего заповедника.</p>
<p>Он ни разу не выстрелил в птицу и не позволял другим охотиться в своих владеньях. Он был другом всех живых существ, и они отвечали ему такой же дружбой.</p>
<p>В заповеднике жили прирученные им гуси, из тех, что каждый октябрь пролетали мимо этих берегов, держа путь из Исландии и Шпицбергена — они летели большими стаями, от которых темнело небо, и наполняли воздух громким плеском своего полета. Были тут большие серые гуси, белогрудые казарки с темными шеями и забавными клоунскими масками, белолобые гуси с черными полосками на груди и множество видов диких уток — кряквы, нырки, шилохвости, чирки и широконоски.</p>
<p>У некоторых из них были подрезаны крылья, чтобы они оставались в заповеднике и могли сообщить своим диким собратьям, появляющимся в этих местах в начале зимы, что здесь их ждут безопасная стоянка и пища. Многие сотни птиц прилетали и оставались с ним всю холодную зиму с октября до ранней весны, когда снова возвращались на север к своим гнездовьям.</p>
<p>Раедеру достаточно было знать, что когда налетают штормовые ветры, или подступают морозы и отыскивать корм становится все труднее, или когда в отдалении гремят ружейные выстрелы, его птицы находятся в безопасности; что он собрал у себя в заповеднике, под опекой собственных рук и сердца, все это множество диких и прекрасных созданий, которые знали его и доверялись ему.</p>
<p>Весной они подчинялись зову севера, но осенью возвращались назад, гукая, гогоча и перекликаясь в осеннем небе, чтобы покружившись над старым маяком, опуститься на землю где-нибудь поблизости и снова сделаться его гостями — он сразу узнавал этих птиц, хорошо помня их с прошлого года.</p>
<p>И Раедер был счастлив, потому что знал, что где-то в глубине их существа жила память о нем и его надежном приюте и что эта память уже стала частью их самих и, с наступлением серых небес и северных ветров, будет неизменно присылать их к нему обратно.</p>
<p>В остальном же сердце его и душа были отданы живописи — он писал эту дикую местность, в которой жил, и ее обитателей. Картин Раедера сохранилось совсем немного. Он ревниво припрятывал их, складывая сотнями в самом маяке и в кладовых наверху. Они никогда не удовлетворяли его — как художник он был бескомпромиссен.</p>
<p>Однако те, что все же нашли покупателя, можно с полным правом назвать шедеврами. В них было мерцание и сложные оттенки отраженного болотами света, ощущение полета, энергия птичьих крыльев, противостоящих утреннему ветру, под которым гнется высокий болотный тростник. Он писал одиночество, запах холодного, просоленного воздуха, нестареющую вечность болот, их диких обитателей, гусиные стаи на рассвете, поднимающихся в воздух вспугнутых птиц и прячущиеся ночью от луны крылатые тени.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap03">В один из ноябрьских дней, спустя три года после появления Раедера на Большой Топи, к его студии на маяке подошла девочка. Она пришла к нему по дамбе и держала что-то в руках. На вид не старше двенадцати лет, она была худая, чумазая, робкая и пугливая, как птица, но при всем при том призрачно красивая, ни дать ни взять — болотная фея. Она была настоящая саксонка, широкая в кости, светловолосая, с крупной головой, до которой телу еще только предстояло дорасти, с глубоко посаженными фиалкового цвета глазами.</p>
<p>Она отчаянно боялась этого уродливого человека, к которому решилась прийти, ведь о Раедере уже начинали ходить слухи, и местные охотники ненавидели его за то, что он становился им поперек дороги.</p>
<p>Но сильнее страха была сейчас забота о другом существе. Где уж она почерпнула эту уверенность, но детское ее сердце не сомневалось, что поселившийся на маяке «людоед» обладал волшебной силой и мог излечивать попавших в беду птиц и животных.</p>
<p>Она никогда еще не видела Раедера живьем и уже готова была кинуться в бегство при виде его темной фигуры, возникшей на пороге студии при звуке ее шагов, — черная голова, такая же черная борода, уродливый горб, скрюченная птичья лапа.</p>
<p>Так она стояла, уставившись на него, как потревоженная болотная птица, готовая в любой момент сняться с места и улететь.</p>
<p>Но голос его, когда он обратился к ней, был глубоким и добрым.</p>
<p>— Что случилось, дитя?</p>
<p>Она продолжала стоять на месте, потом робко приблизилась. То, что она держала в руках, оказалось большой белой птицей, совсем неподвижной. На белом оперенье и на куртке девочки, в том месте, где она прижимала свою ношу к груди, были видны пятна крови.</p>
<p>Девочка переложила птицу к нему на руки.</p>
<p>— Я нашла ее, сэр. Подбитую. Она еще жива?</p>
<p>— Да. Я думаю, что да. Заходи, дитя, заходи.</p>
<p>Держа птицу в руках, Раедер вошел в студию и положил ее на стол, где она еле заметно пошевелилась. Любопытство взяло верх над страхом. Девочка перешагнула порог и оказалась в хорошо протопленной комнате, сверкавшей развешанными по стенам разноцветными картинами и наполненной странным, но приятным запахом.</p>
<p>Птица встрепенулась. Здоровой рукой Раедер расправил одно из ее огромных белых крыльев. Конец его был украшен черной каймой. Раедер залюбовался и спросил:</p>
<p>— Где же ты нашла ее, дитя?</p>
<p>— На болоте, сэр, там были охотники. А… А что это за птица, сэр?</p>
<p>— Это снежный гусь, из Канады. Вернее, гусыня. Но каким таким образом она оказалась здесь?</p>
<p>Название, похоже, мало что говорило девочке. Ее глубокие, сверкавшие с худого перемазанного лица фиалковые глаза были с тревогой устремлены на раненую птицу. Она сказала:</p>
<p>— Вы можете вылечить ее, сэр?</p>
<p>— Да, да, — сказал Раедер. — Постараемся. Давай-ка помоги мне.</p>
<p>На полке были ножницы, бинты, лубки, и он управлялся со всем этим удивительно ловко, даже скрюченная «птичья лапа» не оставалась без дела.</p>
<p>Он сказал:</p>
<p>— Да, ее подстрелили, бедняжку. Перебита нога и конец крыла, но не так уж сильно. Придется подрезать маховые перья, так чтобы можно было наложить повязку, но это ничего — весной перья отрастут, и она снова сможет летать. Привяжем крыло поплотней к туловищу, так чтобы она не могла шевелить им, пока оно не окрепнет, а потом сделаем лубок для этой бедной ноги.</p>
<p>Забыв свои страхи, девочка зачарованно следила за его движениями и слушала удивительную историю, которую он успел рассказать ей, пока накладывал лубок.</p>
<p>Птица была молодая, ей, должно быть, только исполнился год. Она родилась далеко-далеко за морем, в северной земле, принадлежавшей Англии. И когда летела на юг, спасаясь от снега, льда и жестокого мороза, то оказалась застигнута сильной бурей, которая втянула ее в свой вихрь и стала нещадно бить и трепать. То была, действительно, страшная буря, она была сильней ее могучих крыльев, сильней всего на свете. Несколько долгих дней и ночей она держала ее в своих тисках, и птице не оставалось ничего другого, как только лететь впереди нее. Когда же она вырвалась на свободу и, влекомая безошибочным инстинктом, снова устремилась на юг, то очутилась над совсем другой землей, в окружении странных птиц, которых прежде никогда не видела.</p>
<p>Наконец, обессиленная этим тяжким перелетом, она опустилась отдохнуть среди гостеприимного зеленого болота, но, увы, для того лишь, чтобы быть настигнутой выстрелом из охотничьего ружья.</p>
<p>— Не самый лучший прием для заморской принцессы, — заключил Раедер. — Мы будем звать ее La Princess Perdue — Потерянная Принцесса. Через несколько дней ей будет уже намного лучше, вот увидишь.</p>
<p>Он сунул руку в карман и извлек оттуда горсть зерен. Птица открыла свои круглые желтые глаза и покосилась на зёрна с интересом.</p>
<p>Девочка счастливо рассмеялась, но потом вдруг резко перевела дыхание, осознав в один миг, где находится, и, не сказав ни слова, выбежала из студии.</p>
<p>— Постой, постой! — крикнул Раедер, останавливаясь на пороге, — его темная, нескладная фигура казалась теперь заключенной в раму. Девочка уже была на дамбе, но, услыхав его голос, замедлила шаг и обернулась.</p>
<p>— Как тебя зовут?</p>
<p>— Фрит.</p>
<p>— Как? — переспросил Раедер. — А, значит, Фрита. Где ты живешь?</p>
<p>— В рыбацком посёлке, в Уикельдроте, — она произнесла это название на старый саксонский манер.</p>
<p>— Ты придешь завтра или когда-нибудь еще — узнать, как дела у Принцессы?</p>
<p>Она помедлила, и снова Раедер подумал о диких водяных птицах в тот, полный тревоги, миг, когда они застывают в неподвижности перед тем, как подняться в воздух и улететь.</p>
<p>Но ее тонкий голосок все же долетел до него: «Приду!»</p>
<p>В следующую минуту она уже мчалась прочь, и ее светлые волосы развевались на ветру.</p>
<p>Принцесса быстро поправлялась и к середине зимы уже ковыляла по заповеднику вместе с дикими розоволапыми гусями, с которыми чувствовала себя лучше, чем с казарками, и научилась приходить за кормом на зов Раедера. А девочка, Фрит, или Фрита, стала на маяке частой гостьей. Воображенье ее было захвачено присутствием этой странной белой принцессы из далекой заморской страны — страна была целиком розовая, они с Раедером видели ее на карте и проследили весь бурный путь Потерянной Принцессы от ее дома в Канаде до Большой Топи в Эссексе.</p>
<p>Но вот, однажды июньским утром, последняя стая розоволапых гусей, откормленных и жирных после проведенной на маяке зимы, повинуясь мощному зову гнездовий, лениво снялась с места и, постепенно расширяя круги, стала набирать высоту. С ними, сверкая на весеннем солнце белым опереньем и черной каймой крыльев, летел снежный гусь. Случилось, что Фрит как раз была на маяке. На ее крик из студии выбежал Раедер.</p>
<p>— Смотрите! Смотрите! Принцесса! Она что, улетает?</p>
<p>Раедер посмотрел на небо вслед удаляющейся стае.</p>
<p>— Да, — сказал он, непроизвольно копируя ее манеру говорить. — Принцесса возвращается домой. Послушай. Она прощается с нами.</p>
<p>С чистого неба донесся тоскливый отрывистый крик розоволапых гусей и тут же более высокий и чистый звук, который было ни с чем не спутать. Стая удалялась на север и, образовав крошечную букву «v», вскоре совсем исчезла из виду.</p>
<p>После отлета гусыни Фрит перестала появляться на маяке. Раедеру пришлось снова затвердить значение слова «одиночество». В то лето он написал по памяти худенькую перемазанную девочку с развевающимися на ноябрьском ветру светлыми волосами, держащую на руках подстреленную белую птицу.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap04">В середине октября случилось чудо. Раедер кормил птиц на огороженной площадке. Дул седой северо-восточный ветер, и земля вздыхала под наступающим приливом. Вдруг над привычными звуками моря и ветра ему послышалась высокая, чистая нота. Он обратил взгляд к вечернему небу и разглядел вначале далекое еле заметное пятнышко, потом белый с черным мираж, облетевший один раз вокруг старого маяка, и, наконец, самого что ни на есть настоящего снежного гуся, приземлившегося на его площадке и как ни в чем не бывало ковылявшего с важным видом к нему за кормом. Это была Принцесса. Не узнать ее было не возможно. Слезы радости выступили у Раедера на глазах. Где же она пропадала? Ясно, что не дома, не в Канаде. Должно быть, провела лето в Гренландии или на Шпицбергене вместе с розоволапыми. Потом вспомнила — и вернулась.</p>
<p>Когда в следующий раз Раедер появился в Челмбери, он оставил у почтмейстерши послание, которое должно было повергнуть ее в немалое удивление. Он писал: «Скажите Фрит, той, что живет у рыбаков в Уикельдроте, что Потерянная Принцесса вернулась».</p>
<p>Три дня спустя Фрит, успевшая подрасти, но все такая же чумазая и растрепанная, снова пришла на маяк, чтобы навестить La Princesse Perdue.</p>
<p>Шло время. На Большой Топи оно отмечалось высотой приливов, медленным течением сезонов, птичьими перелетами, а для Раедера — появлением и отлетом снежного гуся.</p>
<p>Внешний мир кипел — бурлил и клокотал перед скорым извержением, которому предстояло привести его на край гибели. Но пока это никак не касалось Раедера, а Фрит и подавно.</p>
<p>Жизнь их подчинялась особенному, естественному ритму, который продолжал оставаться неизменным, даже когда девочка подросла. Когда Принцесса была на маяке, Фрит приходила тоже — навещала ее и заодно училась у Раедера массе самых разных вещей. Они плавали вдвоем в его быстрой лодке, которой он так мастерски управлял, ловили диких птиц для все увеличивающейся птичьей колонии и делали для них запруды и ограждения. От него она научилась различать язык диких птиц — от чайки до летавшего над болотами кречета. Иногда она готовила ему еду и даже могла теперь смешивать его краски.</p>
<p>Но когда снежный гусь отправлялся на лето в другие края, между ней и Раедером словно вырастала какая-то преграда, и она переставала бывать на маяке.</p>
<p>В тот год птица не вернулась, и Раедер ходил как в воду опущенный. Мир вокруг потерял для него смысл. Всю зиму и лето он с остервенением писал свои картины, а девочку так ни разу и не видел. Но осенью с неба снова раздался знакомый крик, и огромная белая птица, теперь уже совсем выросшая и окрепшая, появилась с небес также таинственно, как когда-то исчезла. С радостным сердцем Раедер отправился в лодке в Челмбери и оставил на почте записку.</p>
<p>Фрит появилась почему-то только спустя месяц после того, как он оставил свое послание, и Раедер был потрясен, обнаружив, что она уже не ребенок.</p>
<p>После того года, когда Принцесса не вернулась в срок, периоды ее отсутствия становились все короче и короче. Теперь она сделалась такой ручной, что повсюду следовала за Раедером и даже заходила в студию, когда он работал.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap05">Весной 1940 года птицы покидали Большую Топь раньше обычного. Мир был в огне. Завывание и рев бомбардировщиков и грохочущие взрывы спугнули их с места. В первый день мая Фрит и Раедер стояли плечо к плечу на дамбе и смотрели, как последние из свободных гусей и казарок покидают свое пристанище: она — высокая, стройная, свободная, как воздух, и вызывающе красивая; он — темный, нескладный, с поднятой к небу тяжелой, лохматой головой и темными живыми глазами, наблюдающими, как гуси выстраиваются в свой характерный отлетный треугольник.</p>
<p>— Смотрите, Филипп, — сказала Фрит.</p>
<p>Раедер проследил за ее взглядом. Принцесса поднялась в воздух, широко расправив огромные крылья, но летела низко и один раз приблизилась к ним настолько, что в какое-то мгновенье они почти ощутили ласковое прикосновение белых, с черной каймой, перьев, оценив стремительность и силу ее полета. Она облетела маяк один раз, потом другой, потом снова приземлилась посреди огороженной площадки и, присоединившись к гусям с подрезанными крыльями, начала клевать корм.</p>
<p>— Она не улетит, — в голосе Фрит слышалось изумление. Стремительный и такой близкий полет птицы как будто заворожил ее. — Да, Принцесса остается.</p>
<p>— Да, — сказал Раедер, и голос его тоже слегка дрогнул. — Она остается. Она больше никогда не улетит. Потерянная Принцесса нашлась. Вот теперь ее дом — она сама так решила.</p>
<p>Волшебный туман, которым успела окружить ее птица, рассеялся, и Фрит в страхе очнулась. То, что испугало ее, было в глазах Раедера — там была тоска, и одиночество, и что-то глубокое, поднимающееся, невыговоренное, что лежало в них и за ними, когда взгляд его был обращен к ней.</p>
<p>Его последние слова продолжали звучать у нее в голове, как будто он повторил их снова: «Вот теперь ее дом — она сама так решила». Чуткие антенки ее просыпающихся чувств протянулись к нему и донесли до нее все то, о чем он не мог говорить, потому что ощущал себя таким, как есть — уродливым и нелепым.</p>
<p>Его голос всегда успокаивал ее; теперь же испуг ее только усугублялся его молчанием и силой тех невысказанных вещей, что существовали между ними. Женское чутьё подсказывало ей бежать от чего-то, что она пока не в состоянии была объяснить.</p>
<p>Фрит сказала:</p>
<p>— Мне… мне надо идти. До свидания. Я рада, что — Принцесса останется. Теперь вам будет не так одиноко.</p>
<p>Она повернулась и быстро пошла прочь, и его печальное «До свидания, Фрит» было едва уловимым призраком звука, долетевшим до нее вместе с шорохом болотных трав. Она отважилась оглянуться только, когда была уже далеко. Он все еще стоял на дамбе и выглядел маленьким темным пятнышком на фоне неба.</p>
<p>Страх ее уже утих. На смену ему пришло что-то другое — странное чувство утраты, заставившее ее на какое-то мгновение замереть на месте — таким оно было острым.</p>
<p>Дальше она шла уже медленней, удаляясь от указующего в небо перста маяка и застывшего под ним человека.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap06">Прошло немногим больше трех недель прежде, чем Фрит снова появилась на маяке. Был конец мая, и длинные золотые сумерки начинали уступать место серебру луны, уже сиявшей с восточной стороны неба.</p>
<p>Когда ноги сами понесли ее к маяку, она сказала себе, что должна посмотреть, действительно ли Принцесса осталась, ведь Раедер мог ошибаться. Но теперь, когда она снова шла по дамбе, походка ее выдавала сильное волнение и иногда сама она ловила себя на том, что безотчетно ускоряет шаг.</p>
<p>Раедер был на своей маленькой пристани. Вначале Фрит увидела желтый свет его фонаря, потом его самого. Его парусная лодка тихо качалась на приливной волне, а он был занят тем, что складывал в нее припасы — воду, продукты, бутылки бренди, снаряжение и запасной парус. Когда он обернулся на звук ее шагов, она увидела, что он бледен, но темные глаза, обычно такие добрые и спокойные, лихорадочно блестели, и дыхание было тяжелым.</p>
<p>Внезапная тревога охватила Фрит. Гусыня была забыта.</p>
<p>— Филипп, вы собрались куда-то?</p>
<p>Раедер прервал работу, чтобы приветствовать ее, и в его лице, в этом горящем взгляде было что-то, чего она никогда прежде не видела.</p>
<p>— Фрит! Я рад, что ты пришла. Да, я должен отлучиться. Ненадолго. Я вернусь.</p>
<p>Его всегда приветливый голос прозвучал резко, что-то от нее скрывая.</p>
<p>Фрит спросила:</p>
<p>— Куда Вы поплывете?</p>
<p>Теперь Раедера прорвало, и слова ринулись наружу.</p>
<p>Ему нужно плыть в Дюнкерк. За сотню миль отсюда, через Северное море. Часть британской армии оказалась отрезанной там на отмели и будет неизбежно уничтожена наступающими немцами. Порт горит, положение безнадежное. Он услыхал об этом в деревне в очередной поход за продуктами. Откликаясь на призыв правительства, все мужское население Челмбери пришло в движение: буксиры, моторные катера, рыбацкие шхуны отправляются через море — снимать людей с отмелей и переправлять на транспортные суда и эсминцы, которые не могут подойти к берегу из-за мелей. Надо спасти как можно больше людей из-под немецкого обстрела.</p>
<p>Фрит слушала и чувствовала, как сердце в ней умирает.</p>
<p>Он говорил, что переплывет через море в своей маленькой лодке. За один раз она могла захватить шесть человек, в лучшем случае — семь. Он мог проделать маршрут от берега до эсминцев много раз.</p>
<p>По юности и простоте, она не могла понять, что такое война, что происходило во Франции и что означало, что армия оказалась отрезанной, но вся кровь в ней говорила, что тут была опасность.</p>
<p>— Филипп! Вам обязательно плыть? Вы не вернетесь. Почему обязательно вы?</p>
<p>Лихорадочное волнение, владевшее душой Раедера, казалось, прошло, излившись с первым потоком слов, и теперь он мог говорить с Фрит на более понятном ей языке.</p>
<p>Он сказал:</p>
<p>— Люди загнаны на отмели, как птицы, Фрит, как раненые преследуемые птицы, которых нам с тобой случалось находить и приносить в заповедник. Над ними летают стальные ястребы, соколы и кречеты, и им некуда укрыться от этих страшных хищников. Они отрезаны от своих, загнаны бурей и измучены, как La Princesse Perdue, которую ты нашла и принесла ко мне с болот много лет назад, и мы вылечили ее. Им нужна помощь, моя милая, как нужна была нашим диким птицам, вот поэтому-то мне и надо плыть. Это то, что я могу сделать. Да, могу. Хоть раз побыть мужчиной и сделать то, что должен.</p>
<p>Фрит смотрела на Раедера в изумлении. Он так сильно изменился. Только сейчас она заметила, что он больше не был уродливым, нескладным и ущербным — но очень красивым.</p>
<p>Что-то вихрем поднималось в ее собственной душе и кричало, просясь наружу, но она не знала, как это сказать словами.</p>
<p>— Я поплыву с Вами, Филипп.</p>
<p>Раедер покачал головой.</p>
<p>— Ты будешь отнимать место в лодке у какого-нибудь солдата, который вынужден будет остаться, и так — каждый раз. Я должен плыть один.</p>
<p>Он надел сапоги, куртку и направился к лодке.</p>
<p>Потом, обернувшись, помахал рукой и крикнул:</p>
<p>— До свиданья! Посмотришь за птицами, пока меня не будет, Фрит?</p>
<p>Рука Фрит поднялась, чтобы махнуть в ответ, но застыла в воздухе.</p>
<p>— Храни Вас Бог, — произнесла она на свой саксонский манер. — Я посмотрю за птицами. Храни Вас Бог, Филипп.</p>
<p>Была уже ночь, освещенная осколком луны, звездами и северным сиянием. Фрит стояла на дамбе и смотрела на парус, скользящий по разлившимся водам эстуария. Вдруг в темноте, позади нее, раздался шум крыльев, и какая-то тень пронеслась мимо и взмыла в воздух. В ночном свете она смогла различить взмах белых, с черной каймой, крыльев и вытянутую вперед шею снежного гуся.</p>
<p>Набрав высоту, Принцесса облетела один раз вокруг маяка, потом устремилась вдоль извилистого залива туда, где кренился под усиливающимся ветром парус Раедера, и стала описывать над ним широкие медленные круги.</p>
<p>Белый парус и белая птица были еще долго видны на горизонте.</p>
<p>— Смотри за ним, смотри за ним, — прошептала Фрит.</p>
<p>Когда оба силуэта скрылись из виду, она повернулась и, опустив голову, медленно пошла назад к пустому маяку.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap07">Здесь связное повествование прерывается. Дальнейшие события известны из рассказов очевидцев — к примеру, из слов списавшихся на берег моряков, что сидели в пабе «Стрела и Корона» в Ист-Чепеле.</p>
<p>— Гусь это был, самый что не на есть гусь, прости Господи, — сказал рядовой Поттон, из Лондонских королевских стрелков.</p>
<p>— Да ну, — сказал кривоногий артиллерист.</p>
<p>— Гусь — весь как есть. Вот и Джок видел его, не даст соврать. В Дюнкерке, стало быть. Появился прямо из этого ада, вони и дыма у нас над головой. Сам белый, только концы крыльев черные — и как начнет кружить над нами, не хуже какого-нибудь бомбардировщика, будь он неладен. Джок тогда и говорит: «Конец нам. Это ангел смерти пришел по наши души».</p>
<p>«Так я тебе и поверил, — говорю я. — Гусь это, будь он не ладен. Не иначе как с вестью из дома. Небось, передают привет от Черчиля и спрашивают, как нам нравится эта чертова баня. И если уж на то пошло, знак, скорее, добрый — значит, мы еще не безнадежны, дружище».</p>
<p>Жмемся мы, значит, на берегу между Дюнкерком и Ла Панни, что твои голуби на набережной Виктории, и ждем, когда немец по нас шарахнет. Он и шарахал. Только и слышно — то сзади, то сбоку, то над головой. И шрапнелью потчует, и снарядами, и из мессершмитов задает перцу.</p>
<p>А всего в полумиле от проклятых мелей стоит «Кентская дева», эдакая прогулочная баржа — я летом сам не раз на ней плавал из Маргейта, — ждет, чтобы нас подобрать.</p>
<p>И вот лежим мы распластанные на берегу и ругаемся на чем свет стоит, потому что добраться до баржи нет никакой возможности, и вдруг налетает на нее немецкий пикировщик и сыплет бомбы направо и налево, и фонтаны вокруг нее бьют, как в королевских садах, — то еще представление, доложу я вам.</p>
<p>Тут вступается наш эсминец и — так и растак — посылает пикировщика к черту, но в это время налетает другой — и с эсминцем покончено. Он еще горел какое-то время прежде, чем затонуть, и гарь и дым несло на берег, и вот из черно-желтой завесы вылетает этот самый гусь и начинает кружить прямо над нами.</p>
<p>И потом из-за береговой линии возникает он — на маленькой парусной лодчонке — и плывет себе как ни в чем не бывало, как эдакий щеголь, что вышел в летний полдень на морскую прогулку в Хенли.</p>
<p>— Кто это — он? — спросил кто-то из штатских.</p>
<p>— Тот, без кого мы бы не спаслись. Плыл прямо в пекло: немец вел обстрел с бреющего полета. Моторная лодка, та, что еще раньше пыталась снять нас с берега, затонула полчаса назад. Вода шипела от пуль и снарядов. Но он плевал на них, плыл себе, и все тут. Горючего у него не было, так что пожара он не боялся.</p>
<p>И вот появился на отмели, из черного дыма от горящего эсминца — маленький такой, темный, с бородой, с эдакой птичьей лапой заместо руки и горбом за плечами.</p>
<p>Зубами он держал веревку, она здорово выделялась белизной на фоне его черной бороды, вещей в лодке и румпеля. И он — горбун, стало быть, — делает нам знаки, чтобы мы приблизились. А сверху кругами носится этот самый гусь, будь он неладен.</p>
<p>Джок тогда говорит: «Глядите, теперь уж нам точно крышка. Это сам дьявол за нами явился. Только я, верно, совсем ослеп — не узнаю его».</p>
<p>«Ладно тебе, — говорю я ему. — По мне, так он больше походит на милостивого Господа, чем на какого-то дьявола, будь он неладен».</p>
<p>Он и впрямь был как с картинки учебника для воскресной школы — с этим своим бледным лицом, темными глазищами, бородой и этой лодкой в придачу.</p>
<p>«За один раз могу взять семерых», — крикнул он, приблизившись.</p>
<p>Наш офицер гаркнул: «Хорошо, парень!.. Ближняя семерка — валяйте!»</p>
<p>Мы вошли в воду — и к нему. Я был так слаб, что не мог перелезть через борт, но он взял меня за ворот кителя и втащил сам. «Вот так, говорит, парень. Давай, следующий».</p>
<p>В общем, я очнуться не успел, как оказался в лодке. Уж силен он был так силен. Потом ставит парус, что с одного боку весь изрешечен пулями, и кричит: «Пригнитесь, ребята, на случай, если мы повстречаемся с кем-нибудь из ваших друзей», и мы отчаливаем — он сидит на корме, одна веревка — в зубах, другая — в этой его птичьей лапе, правая рука — на румпеле, — так и ведет нас сквозь град снарядов — это старается наземная батарея, что окопалась где-то в глубине на берегу. А гусь этот чертов все кружит и кружит, и сигналит нам сквозь всю эту какофонию, как какой-нибудь чертов «моррис» на объезде в Винчестере.</p>
<p>«Говорил я тебе, что гусь — добрый знак? — говорю я Джоку. — Глянь на небо — ангел Божий, да и только».</p>
<p>А этот, у румпеля, знай, себе поглядывает на гуся: у самого-то веревка в зубах и лыбится на него, как будто уж век его знает.</p>
<p>Доставил он нас на «Кентскую деву», и назад — за следующей партией. И так туда-сюда весь день и всю ночь тоже, потому что Дюнкерк горел так, что и ночью все было видно. Не знаю уж, сколько раз он успел обернуться, но только он, да еще шикарная моторная лодка Темзинского яхт-клуба и подоспевшая потом большая спасательная лодка из Пула забрали нас с этого адского берега — всех до единого.</p>
<p>Мы отплыли только, когда последний из нас был доставлен на борт, и всего было больше семисот человек, а судно-то рассчитано на двести. Он еще был там, когда мы отплыли, и помахал нам на прощание и поплыл в сторону Дюнкерка, и птица опять с ним. Ей Богу, странно было смотреть, как эдакий здоровенный гусь кружит над его лодкой, как белый ангел посреди всего этого огня и дыма.</p>
<p>По пути на нас еще раз налетал пикировщик, но дело было уже к ночи, и он промахнулся. К утру мы благополучно добрались до дома.</p>
<p>Я так и не узнал никогда, что с ним стало и откуда он взялся — с этим своим горбом и парусной лодчонкой.</p>
<p>Но парень был что надо, отличный парень.</p>
<p>— Ну, — согласился артиллерист. — А гусь-то какой. Чудеса, да и только.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap08">В офицерском клубе на Брук-стрит шестидесятипятилетний капитан в отставке Кит Брилл-Оденер рассказывал об эвакуации людей из Дюнкерка.</p>
<p>Поднятый с постели в четыре часа утра, он повел через Дуврский пролив кривобокий буксир, тянувший за собой несколько пустых барж, и четыре раза приводил его назад с эвакуированными солдатами. В последний раз буксир пришел без трубы и с пробоиной в борту. Все же Оденеру удалось привести его обратно в Дувр.</p>
<p>Слушавший его офицер запаса, под которым в последние четыре дня эвакуации подорвались на минах два бриксхемских траулера и один ярмутский дрифтер, сказал:</p>
<p>— А не приходилось вам слышать эту странную легенду о диком гусе? Она обошла тогда все побережье. Знаете, как быстро распространяются подобные истории. Среди моих эвакуированных было несколько человек, которые говорили об этом между собой. Будто гусь появлялся всякий раз между Дюнкерком и Ла Панни, и кто видел его, тот непременно спасался. Что-то в этом роде.</p>
<p>— Хм-м-м, — сказал Брилл-Оденер. — Дикий гусь. Я видел ручного. Чертовски странная история. Трагичная, если уж на то пошло. Но для нас счастливая. Сейчас расскажу. Это было третье возвращенье. К шести часам мы заприметили маленькую неуправляемую лодку. Насколько мы могли судить, в ней должен был находиться человек. Или тело. А на леере сидела большая птица.</p>
<p>Пройдя еще какое-то расстояние, мы сменили курс и стали приближаться. Видит Бог, там действительно был человек или то, что от него осталось, бедняги. Он был ранен из пулемета. Тяжелый случай. Лицо в воде. А птица оказалась гусем — ручным, надо думать.</p>
<p>Мы подошли почти вплотную, но когда один из наших ребят потянулся через борт, птица зашипела на него и стала бить крыльями. Никак не могли отогнать. Вдруг Кеттеринг, что стоял со мной рядом, вскрикнул и показал по правому борту. Плавучая мина. Эдакий плавучий подарок от фрица.</p>
<p>Если бы мы тогда не сменили курс, то нарвались бы прямо на нее. Уф! Была не была. Мы подпустили ее на сотню ярдов к последней барже, и наши ребята подорвали ее, открыв автоматный огонь.</p>
<p>Когда мы снова обернулись к лодке, ее уже не было. Потопило взрывной волной. И парня, видимо, вместе с ней — он был к ней привязан. Птица поднялась в воздух и давала круги. Три круга — как салютующий самолет. Странное было чувство. Потом полетела на запад. Стало быть, так мы и спаслись. Удивительно, что вы спросили о гусе.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap09">Фрит осталась на маленьком маяке, окруженном топью, — продолжала смотреть за птицами с подрезанными крыльями и ждала, сама не зная чего. Первые дни она часто дежурила на дамбе, хотя знала, что это бесполезно. Потом она стала обходить кладовые маяка, где кипами валялись холсты, на которых Раедер запечатлел все оттенки и настроения этих диких мест, не забыв населяющих их чудных, грациозных созданий.</p>
<p>Среди других, ей попалась картина, на которой Раедер изобразил ее по памяти много лет назад, когда она была еще ребенком и стояла растрепанная и перепуганная у него на пороге, прижимая к себе раненую птицу.</p>
<p>До сих пор ничто не волновало ее так сильно, как эта картина и то, что она в ней увидела: в ней было очень много самого Раедера. Странно, но то был единственный раз, когда он писал снежного гуся, эту пригнанную бурей из другой земли дикую птицу, которая подарила каждому из них друга и в конце вернулась к ней с вестью, что она никогда его больше не увидит.</p>
<p>Еще задолго до того, как снежный гусь выпал из багряных облаков на востоке, чтобы совершить последний, прощальный облет маяка, Фрит каким-то древним чутьем текущей в ней крови знала, что Раедер не вернется.</p>
<p>И когда однажды на закате она услыхала раздавшийся с неба высокий и такой знакомый звук, сердце ее ни на минуту не дало обмануть себя ложной надежде. Она как будто уже переживала этот миг много раз.</p>
<p>Она кинулась к дамбе и устремила взгляд не к далекой морской глади, где мог появиться парус, но к небу, из-под пылающих сводов которого обрушился снежный гусь. И это зрелище, этот звук и окружающее ее безмолвие прорвали плотину внутри нее и выпустили наружу неудержимую, ошеломляющую правду ее любви, хлынувшую с потоком слез.</p>
<p>Одна неприкаянная душа выкликала другую, и Фрит казалось, что она летит вместе с этой огромной птицей, паря с ней в вечернем небе и внимая голосу Раедера.</p>
<p>Небо и земля дрожали от этого голоса и переполняли ее так, что она едва могла это вынести. «Фрит! Фрита! Фрит, любовь моя. Прощай, моя любовь». Белые, с черными концами, крылья высекали эти слова у нее в сердце, и сердце ее отвечало: «Филипп, я люблю Вас».</p>
<p>На какой-то миг Фрит показалось, что гусыня хочет опуститься на старой огороженной площадке, потому что гуси с подрезанными крыльями приветственно загалдели. Но она только пронеслась низко над землей, потом взмыла снова, очертила в воздухе широкую плавную спираль вокруг маяка и начала набирать высоту.</p>
<p>Фрит смотрела на нее и видела уже не птицу, но душу Раедера, прощавшуюся с ней перед тем, как уйти навсегда.</p>
<p>Только сама она уже не летела с ней, но была прикована к земле. Она стояла на цыпочках, протягивая руки к небу, словно стараясь дотянуться, и кричала: «Храни Вас Бог! Храни Вас Бог, Филипп!»</p>
<p>Слезы Фрит утихли. Гусыня уже давно исчезла из виду, а она все стояла в тишине и смотрела. Потом зашла в маяк, взяла картину, ту, на которой Раедер изобразил ее с птицей, и, прижимая ее к груди, двинулась по старой морской дамбе в направлении к дому.</p>
<hr />
<p id="transchap10">Каждый вечер на протяжении многих последовавших за тем недель Фрит приходила к маяку и кормила прирученных птиц. Потом однажды под утро немецкий бомбардировщик на раннем рейде принял старый покинутый маяк за действующий военный объект, спикировал на него, кричащий стальной ястреб, и разбомбил подчистую вместе со всем содержимым.</p>
<p>Когда вечером этого дня Фрита пришла к маяку, она увидела только море, набегающее на разрушенные стены. Теперь уже ничто не нарушало заброшенность и пустынность этого места. Ни одна болотная птица не осмеливалась вернуться сюда. И только бесстрашные чайки парили в небе и исторгали свой плач над местом, где раньше стоял маяк.</p>
